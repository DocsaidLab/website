# Introduction

## Daily Life

Reading papers is a truly enjoyable experience!

If you are a seasoned engineer, you probably understand this sentiment.

In our day-to-day project development, we often focus on practical issues like performance, stability, and maintainability. As a result, the technologies and tools we use are relatively fixed, with little room for variation.

Moreover, the demands of extensive work and client communications leave us with little time to stay updated on new technologies.

Before we know it, several years have passed.

We find ourselves lagging behind in terms of technology, with no time to learn new skills because the next requirement is already upon us.

Why do we often say that the career lifespan of an engineer is short?

Because technological iterations typically occur in cycles of three to five years. If we miss two cycles, we are likely to find ourselves on the path to obsolescence.

So, why not take some time to read a few papers with us?

＊

Back to the beginning.

Having the time to read papers in our daily work is a very enjoyable thing.

Unlike researchers who are often overwhelmed by the progress of their papers, we can simply enjoy the insights shared by the authors, understand the challenges they faced, and appreciate the latest academic advancements.

The truths of this universe are hidden within the small observations in each paper. These observations may be incorrect, biased, or wishful thinking on the part of the researchers, but they may also point directly to the core truths. These are all part of the journey of exploring the truth.

We believe that the best way to approach reading papers is with a relaxed attitude and a reverent longing for knowledge.

We think, we record, and we persistently move forward.

We always believe that knowledge is power.

## The Era of Large Language Models

Since the advent of ChatGPT, reading papers has become easier, but this does not mean we can abdicate our responsibility to think.

Here, we document our insights from reading papers with ChatGPT. Our understanding of the papers may be biased or incorrect, so if there is any discrepancy with the original paper, **please refer to the original paper first**.

We also welcome your feedback to help us gain a deeper understanding of these studies.

## Finding Papers

If you are looking for a specific paper, we recommend pasting the paper's title into the search bar at the top right corner for quicker results.

Our writing format is as follows:

- The title includes: [Publication Date] + [Author's Name or Common Industry Name for the Paper]
- The content starts with a brief discussion
- Then defines the problem the paper aims to solve
- Followed by an introduction of the solution
- Concludes with discussion and summary

So, this is not a translation of the paper but more of a guided reading.

Additionally, for the English-speaking audience, although the original papers are already in English, we have decided to ask ChatGPT-4o to help provide English versions of our summaries for the sake of completeness.

If you find any:

- **Broken or incorrect links**
- **Translation errors**
- **Misunderstandings**

Please leave a comment to let us know, and we will prioritize fixing them.

## And Finally

Writing a guided reading of a paper is very time-consuming; the time it takes to write one article could be used to read five papers.

Therefore, the frequency of writing articles depends on the circumstances.

If you have any papers you want to read or discuss, feel free to let us know, and we will take a look if time permits.
