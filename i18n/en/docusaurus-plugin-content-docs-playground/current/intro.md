# Playground

Now that the models are built, it's time to showcase their capabilities!

This is where I demonstrate and test the models. Currently, there's only one demo available, but more exciting models will be added over time for you to explore and play with.

- [**DocAligner Demo**](./docaligner-demo.md) ‚Äì This is a tool that automatically aligns document images. Give it a try!

## A Friendly Reminder

Considering the high cost of cloud hosting, all models are currently deployed on my personal server. As a result, you may experience some minor delays when using these demos. But don't worry, the models have been optimized to perform as efficiently as possible, so with a bit of patience, you'll get the results you're looking for!

## A Small Request üôè

Feel free to use these demos at any time!

However, I kindly ask that you don't "overwork" them. I would really appreciate your cooperation.

Here are some actions that are not allowed:

1. **DDOS Attacks** ‚Äì This would not only harm my server but also prevent other users from enjoying the tools.
2. **Automated Requests via Scripts** ‚Äì Please avoid sending large volumes of requests using scripts or bots, as this could overwhelm the models.

These behaviors could crash my server. In severe cases, I might have to blacklist your IP üòÖ.

Let's all be respectful with resources so that this playground can stay open and running for everyone!

## In Conclusion

The demos currently showcased are just the beginning.

Whether it's image processing, language models, or other machine learning applications, I'll continue to add more to this playground when time permits.
