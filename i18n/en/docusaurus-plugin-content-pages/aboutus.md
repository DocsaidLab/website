# About Us

Welcome to my website.

I am Zephyr, an AI engineer living in Taiwan.

## 👨‍💻 Are you an engineer?

Yes.

I enjoy using scientific knowledge to solve practical problems and find joy in doing so.

A few years ago, people working in image processing would call themselves "Computer Vision Engineers," those working with text would be "Natural Language Engineers," and there were even distinctions between "Machine Learning Engineers" and "Deep Learning Engineers." Within certain small communities, there was a hierarchy based on these different job titles.

But no matter who they were, they all shared a disdain for "AI Engineers":

> Hmph! Another person without any sense trying to trick their way into a title at some company/job opening!

Time passed, and now we are amazed to find that text, images, audio, and other forms of information have been unified in high-dimensional space under the wave of "foundation models," becoming essential tools for ranking, scoring, and publishing papers!

It turns out that these engineers are all doing the same thing, just in different dimensions.

Soon, no one in this field bothers to differentiate between the various engineering titles anymore, as academic research has become interdisciplinary. Researchers now need to know a little bit about every field, or their work simply cannot progress. So, it has become difficult to say exactly what we are.

Looking back, we realize:

> Yes, it's you! AI Engineer!

## 💡 So, what is this?

A while ago, while browsing, I accidentally discovered Meta's open-source [**Docusaurus**](https://docusaurus.io/) and found that it was quite feature-rich.

I thought, why not use it to write a blog? So I combined Docusaurus with GitHub Pages for automatic deployment, and here is the website you're currently viewing. That means if something goes wrong with GitHub, this site will be affected too.

> Therefore, let’s take good care of GitHub and make sure it doesn't break. (~What conclusion is this?~)

Anyway, as I keep tweaking things, this website is almost reaching the limit for GitHub Pages, so it will have to be moved elsewhere soon... (Sigh, life is tough 😮‍💨)

## 🚀 The Origin of the Website Name

I think the most difficult part of "creating a website" is choosing a name.

Analyzing text is my daily work, whether it's image text recognition, image fraud detection, topic classification, keyword extraction, or anything like that. In my view, text is not just words—it can be an image, a video, a song, a dataset, or even a person's behavior. As long as there's analytical value, or we are willing to analyze it, I believe everything can be considered text (chaotic and evil?).

So in the end, I wanted to give this website a name related to the field, and I called it **DOCSAID**.

The name is made up of two words: "DOC" and "SAID." The general meaning is:

> **When text is created, it has already expressed what it intends to say.**

So, what exactly did these texts say? All we need to do is analyze them!

Interestingly, after choosing this name, I realized it even contains the letters "AI" hidden within it—an unexpected bonus.

## 💻 About Website Design

Stop saying my website design is too simple! I know! 😅

My main job is working with models, reading papers, writing code, and tuning parameters—not web design. Especially when it comes to aesthetics, my skills are probably at a kindergarten level. If I don't manage to learn this professional skill, I'll just ask an expert to help me redesign it later.

## ✉️ Contact Information

If you have any questions or are interested in my work, feel free to reach out to me anytime!

This is my job application email: **docsaidlab@gmail.com**. You can send me an email or simply find an article on this site and leave a comment below. I will see it.

## 🍹 Final Note

I have invested a lot of energy into developing these projects and writing learning notes. This process is not only about technical learning but also about giving back to the open-source community.

If this website has helped you, or if you appreciate my efforts, feel free to support me in the following ways:

- [**Buy Me A Coffee**](https://buymeacoffee.com/zephyr_docsaid) to help me maintain the project and develop more new tools.
- Or give a star ⭐️ to the project on GitHub.
- Or leave suggestions or encouragement under the articles you like!

Thank you for reading and supporting. I hope **DOCSAID** can bring you help and inspiration!
