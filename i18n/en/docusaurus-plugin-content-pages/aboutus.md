## 👨‍💻 My Story

Yes, I am an engineer.

I am passionate about solving real-world problems using scientific knowledge and derive endless joy from it.

In the past, the field of engineering was categorized in great detail:

- Those working on images were called "Computer Vision Engineers"
- Those working on text were called "Natural Language Engineers"
- There were also "Machine Learning Engineers," "Deep Learning Engineers," and even a certain hierarchy of job titles.

However, everyone seemed to share a common disdain for "AI Engineers":

> Hmph, another one without any sense, trying to ride the wave of hype with their company/position/job seeker!

But with the rise of "foundation models," multidimensional information such as text, images, and audio has been unified in high-dimensional space, and people were amazed to find:

> It turns out that these engineers are actually doing the same thing, just with different dimensions.

Today, cross-field collaboration has become the norm, technical barriers are no longer clear, and the boundaries of job titles have blurred. We’ve ultimately returned to the original starting point:

> **AI Engineer**!

## 💡 About DOCSAID

This is the birthplace of **DOCSAID**, a platform for technical documentation and sharing.

I recently stumbled upon [**Docusaurus**](https://docusaurus.io/), a static site generator open-sourced by Meta, which is feature-rich and perfect for building blogs and technical documentation. So, I used it in combination with GitHub Pages to automatically deploy this website. What you see now was made possible by that.

Yes, the stability of this website depends entirely on the proper functioning of GitHub.

So, let’s take good care of GitHub and keep it running smoothly! 😉

## 🚀 The Origin of the Website Name

For me, naming is a huge challenge.

My daily work revolves around "text analysis," whether it's image text recognition, fraud detection, topic classification, or keyword extraction, all of which are related to text. To me, the definition of text is quite broad:

- It can be a piece of writing, an image, a video, a song, or even a person's behavior.

As long as there is value in analysis, it is worth exploring.

Thus, the website was named **DOCSAID**. The name comes from two words: "DOC" and "SAID," meaning:

> The moment text is created, it has already told all its stories.

Our task is to analyze and interpret what the text "says."

Interestingly, after completing the name, I was delighted to discover that "AI" is hidden within "DOCSAID"!

A delightful surprise.

## 💻 About the Website Design

If you think my website design is a bit simple, it’s because — well, I know! 😅

As an AI engineer, my expertise is in model building and parameter tuning. As for web design… I’d say my skills are probably still at a kindergarten level. In the future, if I get the chance, I’ll try to improve in this area, or perhaps leave it to a professional designer to optimize.
