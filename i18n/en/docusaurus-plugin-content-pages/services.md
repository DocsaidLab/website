# Technical Services

I am a deep learning and full-stack engineering practitioner, specializing in **practical, results-driven** AI consulting and technical support.

From paper concepts, model selection, and system design to API deployment and website construction, I can assist you in quickly transforming your "ideas" into "applications."

> üí° **Rather than spending a lot of time figuring out AI tools, it's better to work with an engineering consultant who understands the implementation context.**
>
> What I offer is not just models and code, but tailored technical planning, stable deployment, and smooth go-live according to your needs.

## Additional Notes

- If your project involves **large language models (LLM), RAG applications, chatbots, or other NLP-related tasks**, I can provide initial technical advice and system evaluations. However, due to limited computational power, I **do not offer training of LLMs or large-scale language task development**.

- **For services outside of Taiwan or English-speaking markets, the timeline will be evaluated separately (due to time zone communication, NDA, and other considerations). Feel free to reach out to discuss.**
