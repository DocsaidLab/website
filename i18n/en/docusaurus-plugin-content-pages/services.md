# Technical Services

I am a deep learning and full-stack engineer, focusing on **practical, application-oriented** AI consulting and technical support.

From conceptualizing papers, model selection, system design, to API deployment and website construction, I can help you quickly transform your "ideas" into "applications."

> 💡 **Rather than spending extensive time exploring AI tools, leave it to an engineering consultant who is familiar with the implementation context.**
>
> What I provide is not just models and code, but assistance in planning the technical implementation route, ensuring stable deployment, and smooth launch based on your needs.

⚠️ If your needs involve **Large Language Models (LLM), RAG applications, chatbots, or other NLP projects**, I can still provide initial technical advice and system evaluations, but due to computational limitations, I **do not offer self-training LLM or large-scale language task development**.

---

💳 All services are currently paid via [**Buy Me a Coffee**](https://buymeacoffee.com/docsaid), with **1 cup of coffee = USD 5 ≒ NTD 150**. The following prices are **base rates**, and the final pricing will be flexible depending on project scope, complexity, data quality, and number of revisions.

> ⚠️ **For services outside Taiwan or English-speaking markets, pricing and timelines will be reassessed due to additional considerations like cross-timezone communication, NDAs, and international payment processes. Feel free to reach out for discussions.**

## 📘 Technical Paper Reviews and Application Strategy Recommendations

When you find an interesting paper but are unsure if it’s worth implementing, whether it suits your use case, or if there are alternative solutions, I can help you:

- Extract the technical core and application highlights of the paper
- Evaluate if it truly fits your task
- Compile related open source repos, implementation difficulty, and deployment risks
- Suggest actionable next steps (such as testing, small-scale experiments, quick API implementation, etc.)

📌 **Ideal when you need:**

- To assess if this method is worth investing in development
- To compare multiple models and make quick selection decisions
- To quickly convince your team, boss, or investors with a report

I don’t just "translate" the paper for you; I "interpret" it into decision-making and implementation guidelines.

📎 **Example reference**:
You can refer to my review article [**Face Anti-Spoofing Technical Roadmap**](https://docsaid.org/en/blog/fas-paper-roadmap), where I selected 40 representative papers from over 135, categorized them into 8 major themes, and created an introductory roadmap for the FAS field.

## ❓ Q&A ｜ Frequently Asked Questions

- **Q1: Why not just use ChatGPT or other AI tools directly?**

  Anyone can use AI, but without background knowledge, it's easy to be "led into strange corners" by the model. Instead of spending weeks experimenting, you can use a day's worth of consulting hours to quickly clarify the direction and deliver results.

  ***

- **Q2: What if I have many ideas but don't know how to write them clearly? Can we collaborate?**

  Absolutely. I specialize in turning "abstract ideas" into "concrete technical tasks," helping you define goals, implement in phases, and list possible technical paths and execution orders.

  ***

- **Q3: Aren't AI tools cheaper?**

  On the surface, yes, but in reality:

  - ChatGPT / Claude subscriptions range from USD $20 to $200 per month.
  - AI tools can give you "answers," but they can't "make choices" or take "responsibility."
  - Without a technical background, you might spend a lot of time "asking the wrong questions" or "failing to integrate."

  What I provide is **validated, deliverable, and logically structured result-oriented technical services**. You can focus on business decisions, and I'll handle the tools and technical implementation.

  ***

- **Q4: I'm not an engineer; can I still collaborate?**

  Of course. Many of my collaborators are startup founders, researchers, or product managers. I will:

  - Explain technical options in a way that's easy for non-engineers to understand
  - Assist in writing presentations, organizing documents, and drafting API documentation
  - Make sure you clearly understand each step of the deliverables and why it's being done

  ***

- **Q5: What if my budget is limited? Can we work in stages?**

  Yes, all services can be quoted and executed in stages, including:

  - Starting with a small amount of consulting hours to clarify direction
  - Splitting the project into MVPs, small modules, or Proof-of-Concepts based on your budget
  - Future flexibility to expand or hand over to an internal team for maintenance

  If you're a student or an open-source author, feel free to let me know. I may offer reasonable discounts or open-source collaboration options.

  ***

- **Q6: Do the deliverables have a standard format? How is the acceptance process?**

  Each task will have a clear scope and format for delivery, commonly including:

  - Markdown documents / PDF reports / Notion pages
  - API Swagger documentation / execution screenshots / demo website links
  - Docker images / Git repos
  - Online presentations and user guides

  The number of revisions, warranty scope, and testing criteria will also be agreed upon in advance to ensure clear communication.

  ***

- **Q7: Can we sign an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)?**

  Of course.

  If you need an NDA or internal documentation agreement, feel free to provide the terms or use one of my standard templates. I respect the intellectual property and commercial sensitivity of all my collaborators.

  ***

- **Q8: If there are issues after deployment, does it include maintenance?**

  Generally, I provide **short-term warranty** (typically 1-2 weeks) to ensure the service operates smoothly. Long-term maintenance or feature expansions would require a separate agreement or hourly charge. If risks arise due to models or third-party services provided by the client, I will notify you in advance and negotiate a solution.
