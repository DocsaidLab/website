# Technical Services

I am a deep learning and full-stack engineer, focused on **application-oriented** AI consulting and technical support.

From paper concepts, model selection, system design to API deployment and website construction, I can help you quickly transform your "ideas" into "applications."

> üí° **Instead of spending a lot of time experimenting with AI tools, why not entrust the work to an engineering consultant familiar with the implementation context?**
>
> What I provide is not just models and code, but assistance in planning technical implementation routes, ensuring stable deployments, and a smooth go-live based on your needs.

üìå **The technical application areas I specialize in include:**

- **Document Understanding and Document AI**
  - Text detection, text recognition, document classification, key-value extraction
- **Facial Technology and Identity Verification Applications**
  - Face detection, face recognition, liveness detection (Face Anti-Spoofing)
- **Image Recognition and Object Analysis**
  - Object detection, classification, localization, document classification, and other scene integrations
- **API Integration and Deployment of AI Models**
  - Deploying models using FastAPI / Docker / Local private environments

:::warning
If your needs involve **large language models (LLM), RAG applications, chatbots, or other NLP projects**, I can provide initial technical advice and system evaluations, but due to limited computing power, I **do not offer self-trained LLM or large-scale language task development**.
:::

:::warning
**For services outside of Taiwan or English-speaking markets, pricing and timelines will be evaluated separately (due to considerations like cross-time zone communication, NDAs, and international payment processes). Feel free to reach out for consultation.**
:::

:::info
All services currently use [**Buy Me a Coffee**](https://buymeacoffee.com/zyuan) as the payment channel, with USD as the pricing unit.

> **1 coffee = USD 5 ‚âí NTD 150**.

The following quotes are **basic starting prices**, and the final pricing will be flexible based on factors such as project scope, complexity, data quality, and the number of revisions. Please confirm with me via email before placing an order.

## üìò Technical Paper Reading and Application Strategy Advice

Have you found a paper that interests you, but you're not sure whether it's worth implementing, if it fits your scenario, or what alternatives exist?

I can help you:

- Extract the core technical points and application highlights of the paper
- Evaluate whether it is truly suitable for your task
- Organize related open-source repositories, implementation difficulty, and deployment risks
- Suggest feasible next steps (such as testing, small-scale experiments, quick API implementation, etc.)

üìå **This is suitable when you need:**

- To understand if a method is worth developing
- To compare multiple models and make a quick decision
- To quickly convince your team/boss/investors with a report

I won‚Äôt just "translate" the paper for you, I‚Äôll "reinterpret" it into actionable decisions and implementation guidelines.

:::tip
üìé **Example Reference**: You can refer to the reading guide article I wrote:

> [**Face Anti-Spoofing Technology Roadmap**](https://docsaid.org/en/blog/fas-paper-roadmap).

This is an example where I selected 40 papers from over 135, organizing them into eight major themes to create an introductory map for the FAS field.

## ‚ùì Q&A | Frequently Asked Questions

- **Q1: Why not just use ChatGPT or other AI tools directly?**

  Anyone can use AI, but without background knowledge, it's easy to get led into "strange corners" by the model. Instead of spending weeks experimenting, you can use a day's worth of consultant hours to quickly clarify your direction and deliver results.

  ***

- **Q2: What if I have a lot of ideas but don‚Äôt know how to write them clearly? Can we still collaborate?**

  Absolutely. I specialize in transforming "abstract ideas" into "concrete technical tasks," helping you define goals, implement them step by step, and list alternative technical paths and execution sequences.

  ***

- **Q3: Aren't AI tools cheaper?**

  On the surface, yes, but in reality:

  - ChatGPT / Claude subscription starts from about USD $20 to $200 per month.
  - AI tools can give you "answers," but they can‚Äôt help you "make choices" or "take responsibility."
  - Without a technical background, you might waste a lot of time asking "the wrong questions" or "failing to integrate."

  What I provide is **validated, deliverable, logical, and results-oriented technical services**. You can focus on business decisions while I handle the tools and technical implementation.

  ***

- **Q4: Can I collaborate if I'm not an engineer?**

  Of course. Many of my clients are startup founders, researchers, or product managers. I will:

  - Explain technical options in a way that anyone can understand
  - Assist in preparing presentations, organizing documents, and writing API documentation
  - Help you clearly understand what each deliverable is and why it's being done

  ***

- **Q5: What if I have a limited budget? Can we execute the project in phases?**

  Yes. All services can be quoted and executed in phases, including:

  - Clarifying the direction with a small amount of consulting hours first
  - Breaking the project into MVPs, small modules, or Proof-of-Concepts based on the budget
  - Flexible expansion or handing over to your internal team for continued maintenance

  If you‚Äôre a student or open-source author, feel free to explain your situation, and I may offer reasonable discounts or open-source collaboration opportunities.

  ***

- **Q6: Do deliverables have a standard format? How is acceptance handled?**

  Each task will have a clearly defined delivery scope and format. Common formats include:

  - Markdown documents / PDF reports / Notion pages
  - API Swagger documentation / Execution screenshots / Demo website links
  - Docker images / Git repositories
  - Online presentations and operational guides

  The number of revisions, warranty coverage, and test criteria will also be pre-agreed to ensure clear communication.

  ***

- **Q7: Can we sign an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)?**

  Absolutely.

  If you need an NDA or internal agreement, you can provide your terms, or I can use my standard agreement templates. I respect the intellectual property and business sensitivity of every collaborator.

  ***

- **Q8: If issues arise after deployment, is maintenance included?**

  A **short-term warranty** (usually 1 to 2 weeks) is provided to ensure the service operates normally. However, long-term maintenance or feature expansions will require a separate contract or hourly fees. If the issues are due to models or third-party services provided by the client, we will notify you in advance and discuss solutions.
