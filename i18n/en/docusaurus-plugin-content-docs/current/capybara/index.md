# Capybara

:::info
We have invited new developers to join us and started restructuring DocsaidKit, splitting part of it into this project. The overall content will not change significantly, and we will gradually migrate dependencies of other packages to Capybara. Until the migration is completed, we will continue maintaining DocsaidKit. Once Capybara is finalized, DocsaidKit will be deprecated.
:::

This project is positioned as an image processing and deep learning toolkit.
