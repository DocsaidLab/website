# Capybara

:::info
We have invited new developers to join and started refactoring DocsaidKit, splitting part of it into this project. The overall content will remain unchanged, and we will gradually migrate dependencies from other packages to Capybara. We will continue maintaining DocsaidKit until the migration is complete, after which DocsaidKit will be deprecated.
:::

This project is focused on image processing, file manipulation, and everyday tools, serving as a toolbox we left behind during development.
