# Capybara

:::info
We have invited new developers to join and started refactoring DocsaidKit, splitting part of it into this project, and providing PyPI installation.

The general content will remain unchanged. We will gradually migrate the dependencies of other packages to Capybara. DocsaidKit will continue to be maintained until the migration is complete. Once all migrations are finished, we will deprecate DocsaidKit.
:::

This project is an image processing tool based on OpenCV, with functionalities such as file format conversion, searching, and other daily development tools. It is a library accumulated from our development process over the past few years.
