Upon seeing this title, you might smirk and think, "Isn't it just a classification model?"

- Yes, and no.

This time, we aim to create an atypical classification model. While its application scope may be limited, its intrinsic interest is quite high.

It might not be what you imagine, but if you have time, you might as well continue reading.

:::info
This project was conceived and proposed by [**kunkunlin1221**](https://github.com/kunkunlin1221), who completed the initial program development and feasibility verification.Since he didn't have time to write the web page, he entrusted this idea to me to continue the details and publish it here.

I would like to express my special thanks to him for his contribution.
