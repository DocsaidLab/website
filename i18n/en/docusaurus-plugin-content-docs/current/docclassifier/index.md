Upon seeing this title, you might be confused: isn't this just a classification model? It sounds pretty ordinary!

> Well, yes and no.

This time, we aim to build a non-typical classification model. It may have limited application, but the fun in creating it is immense.

In this project, we do not use the traditional cross-entropy loss function for the final classification results. Instead, we employ a similarity learning approach for classification. The overall effect is quite good, and if you have the time, feel free to keep reading.

:::info
This project was conceived and initiated by [**kunkunlin1221**](https://github.com/kunkunlin1221), who completed the early stages of program development and feasibility verification. Since he didn't have time to write the website, he entrusted me with continuing the work, refining the details, and publishing it here.

A special thanks to him for his contribution.
