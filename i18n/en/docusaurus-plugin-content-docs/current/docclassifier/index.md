Upon seeing this title, you might smirk and think, "Isn't it just a classification model?"

- Yes, and no.

This time, we aim to create an atypical classification model. While its application scope may be limited, its intrinsic interest is quite high.

It might not be what you imagine. Please continue reading.

:::info
This project has a unique origin. It was conceived by my friend: [**Jack, L.**](https://github.com/Jack-Lin-NTU)

Because he didn't have time to write the web page, he completed the early-stage program development and feasibility verification first. Then, he entrusted me with this idea, allowing me to continue to complete the details and publish them here. I would like to express my special thanks to him for his contribution.
