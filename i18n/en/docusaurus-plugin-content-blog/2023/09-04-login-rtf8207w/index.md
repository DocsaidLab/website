Today, we're going to talk about logging into Chunghwa Telecom's little turtle, the RTF8207W modem.

<!-- truncate -->

First off, the actual device doesn't look anything like the cover image; that's just a figment of GPT's imagination.

But I digress, let's get back to it:

### 1. Accessing the Management Interface

Typically, you can access it through a web browser by entering `192.168.1.1` or another IP address. The specific address might vary depending on your router model.

### 2. Default Credentials

Usually, the username is: `cht`, and the password is `last four digits of the model + last four digits of the MAC address`.

### 3. Logging In

And then, you're free to do as you please.
