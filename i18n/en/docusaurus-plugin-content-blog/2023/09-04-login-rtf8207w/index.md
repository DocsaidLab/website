This time, I want to log into the Chunghwa Telecom "Turtle," the RTF8207W modem.

### 1. Login to the Management Interface

You can usually access it by entering `192.168.1.1` or another IP address into your web browser. The specific address may vary depending on your router model.

</div>

### 2. Engineer Account

Typically, the username is `cht`, and the password is the last four digits of the model number plus the last four digits of the MAC address.

### 3. Login

Once logged in, you can do whatever you need.
