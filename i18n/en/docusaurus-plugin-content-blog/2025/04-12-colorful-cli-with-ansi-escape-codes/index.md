description: Get to know ANSI Escape Codes and bring some color to your CLI output.

Have you ever questioned life while writing a CLI tool or debugging output?

> **"Why does the information I just printed look like a plain bowl of noodles with no toppings?"**

Sorry, I don't mean to offend noodles, I just want to say:

If you want your terminal to be more recognizable and allow you to spot key information at a glance, then you need to get to know a subtle but powerful player:

- **ANSI Escape Codes**.

<!-- truncate -->

## What Are They?

ANSI stands for **American National Standards Institute**, an organization responsible for setting various standards, including character encoding for computers.

ANSI Escape Codes are sequences of characters that look like random code. They usually begin with `\033[` or `\x1b[`, followed by various control codes.

Here's an example:

```python
print("\033[1;31mHello World\033[0m")
```

This code will print "Hello World" in bold red text. The `\033[0m` at the end is a reset code, preventing the following output from being affected by the red color.

## Common Formatting Control Codes

You can use these values to style the text:

<div style={{
  whiteSpace: 'nowrap',
  overflowX: 'auto',
  fontSize: '1rem',
  lineHeight: '0.8',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  display: 'flex',
}}>

| Code | Effect           |
| :--: | ---------------- |
|  0   | Reset (default)  |
|  1   | Bold             |
|  2   | Dim              |
|  3   | Italic           |
|  4   | Underline        |
|  7   | Invert (reverse) |

</div>

These can be combined with colors to create a "personalized outfit" for your CLI.

**Fun Fact About ANSI Control Codes: Where Did 5 and 6 Go?**

They've always been around, but most people never see them.

- **5 = Slow Blink**
- **6 = Rapid Blink**

However...

**Almost no terminal supports them**, especially modern systems that disable blink effects to avoid eye strain.

You can try it yourself:

```python
print("\033[5;31mThis is a slow-blinking red text\033[0m")
```

If it actually blinks, congratulations! Your terminal is stuck in the ancient times üòÖ

## Color Control Codes

The text color codes in ANSI Escape Codes typically range from 30‚Äì37 (standard colors) and 90‚Äì97 (bright colors).

Here is the corresponding table:

<div style={{
  whiteSpace: 'nowrap',
  overflowX: 'auto',
  fontSize: '1rem',
  lineHeight: '0.8',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  display: 'flex',
}}>

| Code  | Color         |
| :---: | ------------- |
|  30   | Black         |
|  31   | Red           |
|  32   | Green         |
|  33   | Yellow        |
|  34   | Blue          |
|  35   | Magenta       |
|  36   | Cyan          |
|  37   | White         |
| 90‚Äì97 | Bright Colors |

</div>

Background color codes correspond to 40‚Äì47 (standard colors) and 100‚Äì107 (bright colors), and they follow the same pattern as above:

<div style={{
  whiteSpace: 'nowrap',
  overflowX: 'auto',
  fontSize: '1rem',
  lineHeight: '0.8',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  display: 'flex',
}}>

|  Code   | Background Color                       |
| :-----: | -------------------------------------- |
|   40    | Black (Background)                     |
|   41    | Red (Background)                       |
|   42    | Green (Background)                     |
|   43    | Yellow (Background)                    |
|   44    | Blue (Background)                      |
|   45    | Magenta (Background)                   |
|   46    | Cyan (Background)                      |
|   47    | White (Background)                     |
| 100‚Äì107 | Corresponding Bright Background Colors |

</div>

**You may notice that codes from `38` to `89` are rarely mentioned ‚Äî so where did they go?**

- **38 and 48: Advanced Usage for Custom Colors**

  - `38` = Enable "custom foreground color" mode
  - `48` = Enable "custom background color" mode

  At this point, you need to specify the color with additional parameters, such as 256 colors (8-bit mode):

  ```python
  print("\033[38;5;198mA pink text\033[0m")
  ```

  - `38;5;198` refers to color number 198 from the 256-color palette.

  Or, use True Color (24-bit mode):

  ```python
  print("\033[38;2;255;105;180mHello in pink!\033[0m")
  ```

  - `38;2;<r>;<g>;<b>` allows you to precisely specify RGB values.

- **39 and 49: The Reset Color Friends**

  - `39`: Reset to the default foreground color
  - `49`: Reset to the default background color

:::tip
**What About 50 to 89?**

They don't mean anything!

This range of values is **not explicitly defined** in the ANSI specification; it is reserved or part of a historical gap. A few terminals (like certain Konsole/xterm) have experimentally used them, but they are not standard features.

If you force these values, most terminals won‚Äôt care.
:::

So, let‚Äôs summarize the color code map:

<div style={{
  whiteSpace: 'nowrap',
  overflowX: 'auto',
  fontSize: '1rem',
  lineHeight: '0.8',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  display: 'flex',
}}>

|   Range   | Function                                      |
| :-------: | --------------------------------------------- |
|   30‚Äì37   | Standard foreground colors                    |
|   90‚Äì97   | Bright foreground colors                      |
|  **38**   | Advanced foreground colors (256 colors / RGB) |
|  **39**   | Reset foreground color                        |
|   40‚Äì47   | Standard background colors                    |
|  100‚Äì107  | Bright background colors                      |
|  **48**   | Advanced background colors (256 colors / RGB) |
|  **49**   | Reset background color                        |
| **50‚Äì89** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Reserved, do not touch lightly             |

</div>

Here‚Äôs a program to play around with:

```python
for i in range(256):
    print(f"\033[48;5;{i}m {i:3} \033[0m", end=" ")
    if i % 16 == 15:
        print()
```

After running it, it will look something like this:

import Ansi256Grid from '@site/src/components/Ansi256Grid';

<Ansi256Grid />

## Combination Syntax Examples

The syntax format is:

```
\033[<format>;<text color>m
```

Example:

```python
def colorstr(text, fmt=1, color=34):
    return f"\033[{fmt};{color}m{text}\033[0m"

print(colorstr("This is a bold blue text"))
```

A bit trendier:

```python
print("\033[1;34;43mBlue text on yellow background, fashion explained\033[0m")
```

## Notes

There are a few things to keep in mind when using color so that your output doesn't turn into a disaster:

- **Always reset**: Without `\033[0m`, your output will inherit the color, turning a simple red message into a long red novel.
- **Jupyter has many limitations**: While it can display color, cursor control and screen manipulation are mostly a dream.
- **Windows Terminal has been updated**: The new version finally does a good job; for the old version, use `colorama`.
- **Don‚Äôt mess with log files**: Unless you enjoy torturing yourself with regular expressions, it's better to save the text as plain text.

## Extended Applications

You can wrap your own color utility module and even use Enum to write a cleaner call method:

```python
from enum import Enum

class COLOR(Enum):
    RED = 31
    GREEN = 32
    BLUE = 34

class FORMAT(Enum):
    BOLD = 1
    UNDERLINE = 4

def colorstr(obj, color=COLOR.BLUE, fmt=FORMAT.BOLD):
    return f"\033[{fmt.value};{color.value}m{obj}\033[0m"
```

Application scenarios:

- **Error and warning messages**: Use red to say ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a problem here.‚Äù
- **Success messages**: A green checkmark is just delightful.
- **Interactive menu prompts**: Let the user know what to enter next.

## Don‚Äôt Want to Handle It Yourself?

Many libraries have already packaged this for you, so you can use them directly.

Here are a few Python libraries you can refer to:

1. **`colorama`**

   Solves cross-platform display issues, a Windows helper, and is easy to use:

   ```python
   from colorama import init, Fore, Style
   init()
   print(Fore.RED + "Hello in red!" + Style.RESET_ALL)
   ```

2. **`termcolor`**

   Provides `colored()`, no fuss:

   ```python
   from termcolor import colored
   print(colored("Warning", "red", attrs=["bold"]))
   ```

3. **`rich`**

   Supports colors, tables, progress bars, Markdown‚Äîit's like React for CLI.

   ```python
   from rich import print
   print("[bold red]This is a bold red text[/bold red]")
   ```

## Summary

Mastering ANSI Escape Codes is like adding a color palette to your terminal.

From debugging to CLI tool development, you can create the most eye-catching effects with minimal tools.

More importantly, it allows users to quickly recognize "red is an error," "green is good," and "yellow means wait," without getting lost in a sea of black-and-white messages.

Make the terminal world colorful, starting with `\033[`.
