No matter when or where, no matter how I climb the steps.

Every time I look up at the sky, I always feel as small as an ant.

So, I did something boringâ€”talked to ChatGPT.

## Dialogue

<UserCard>
Let's imagine something.
Suppose we divide scientists and engineers in the field of deep learning into ten levels.
If each level had to be expressed in one sentence describing their work status,
Based on your past knowledge and understanding of the world, what would each of these ten levels be like?
</UserCard>

<ChatGPTCard>
Here is a possible imaginative development, from beginner to master level, with a vivid one-sentence description of each stage of a deep learning scientist or engineerâ€™s work:

1. **Beginner**
"I need to understand what these math symbols and codes are doing."

2. **Early Exploration**
"I want to successfully train my first neural network model."

3. **Basic Engineer**
"I need to learn how to optimize parameters and solve convergence problems with the model."

4. **Skilled Engineer**
"I hope to improve the modelâ€™s performance and find better training techniques and processes."

5. **Advanced Engineer**
"Iâ€™m thinking about how to systematically improve the model architecture and deploy it effectively into production."

6. **Senior Researcher**
"I'm researching how to integrate methods from different fields and propose new techniques."

7. **Domain Expert**
"I want to propose an innovative idea or theory that has the potential to influence the entire research community."

8. **Technical Leader**
"I am leading a team to try and solve key problems that have long been unresolved in the industry or academia."

9. **Academic Authority**
"I hope to establish a new research paradigm and redefine the research direction of the entire field."

10. **Thought Leader (Master Level Guru)**
"I want to explore and clarify the essence of intelligence and learning, laying a new theoretical foundation for the next generation of intelligent systems."

<UserCard>
If we use quantified experience values as a metaphor, what would the gap between these ten levels be approximately?
</UserCard>

<ChatGPTCard>
If we consider the differences between these ten levels in terms of quantified experience values, taking into account that the learning curve in deep learning shows "exponential" or "nonlinear" growth, here is an approximate distribution:

| Level | Role Description           | Experience Value (Quantified Metaphor) |
|-------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1     | Beginner                   | 1                                     |
| 2     | Early Exploration           | 5                                     |
| 3     | Basic Engineer              | 20                                    |
| 4     | Skilled Engineer            | 100                                   |
| 5     | Advanced Engineer           | 500                                   |
| 6     | Senior Researcher           | 2,500                                 |
| 7     | Domain Expert               | 12,500                                |
| 8     | Technical Leader            | 62,500                                |
| 9     | Academic Authority          | 312,500                               |
| 10    | Thought Leader (Master Guru)| 1,500,000+                            |

#### ðŸ”‘ Design Logic:
- The difference between each level is roughly 5 times that of the previous level, forming exponential growth.
- The gap between the top and bottom levels exceeds a million times, fully illustrating the vast divide between top thinkers and beginners.
</ChatGPTCard>

<UserCard>
With AI tools prevailing, they should be able to narrow the gap for lower-level developers or researchers. If we consider AI tools, what would the corresponding experience values be like?
</UserCard>

<ChatGPTCard>
Youâ€™ve made a very good observation.

AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Copilot, AutoML) do indeed significantly lower the threshold for beginners and mid-level developers, boosting their work efficiency and even allowing them to approach engineers several levels higher than themselves.

Considering the additive effect of AI tools, here are the adjusted experience values that reflect reality more accurately:

| Level | Role Description          | Without AI Tools | With AI Tools |
|-------|---------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| 1     | Beginner                  | 1                | 20            |
| 2     | Early Exploration          | 5                | 50            |
| 3     | Basic Engineer             | 20               | 100           |
| 4     | Skilled Engineer           | 100              | 400           |
| 5     | Advanced Engineer          | 500              | 1,500         |
| 6     | Senior Researcher          | 2,500            | 6,000         |
| 7     | Domain Expert              | 12,500           | 20,000        |
| 8     | Technical Leader           | 62,500           | 90,000        |
| 9     | Academic Authority         | 312,500          | 400,000       |
| 10    | Thought Leader (Master Guru)| 1,500,000+      | 1,600,000+    |

#### ðŸ”‘ Main Logic:
- **Low-level Developers (Levels 1-4)**: AI tools have the biggest impact, boosting experience by about 20 times (helping them learn faster, solve difficulties, and accomplish tasks they couldnâ€™t previously).
- **Mid and High-level (Levels 5-7)**: AI tools still make a significant difference, but the gap gradually narrows, increasing experience by about 1.5 to 3 times (improving productivity, overcoming bottlenecks, but still requiring solid experience and understanding).
- **Top Researchers (Levels 8-10)**: The influence of AI tools is relatively small, as the decisive factors at this stage come from innovation, deep thinking, intuition, experience, and breakthroughs in theory. AI can only assist.

This adjustment more accurately reflects the actual help provided by AI tools and their impact at different stages. It also clearly explains that the most important gap between top talents in the field still lies in higher-level insight and innovation ability, rather than mere execution efficiency.

## Beyond Technology

As for whether the real-world gap truly follows this five-fold pattern, I canâ€™t say for certain.

However, that feeling of looking up at the top power is, from my perspective, quite close to reality. And within the final few levels, there can often be huge differences in power even among individuals at the same level. This also matches what we observe in real life.

The reality is that the gap between each level is not something that can be bridged by sheer effort alone, and we should be mentally prepared for that. But effort can definitely improve oneâ€™s experience, especially when taking on higher-level challengesâ€”experience gains are faster in such cases.

Lastly, the current AI tools are truly powerful, and boosting combat power by 20 times at the beginner level seems like a very reasonable estimate. But as we level up, the help from AI tools becomes smaller, and at times, they can even become a burden.

So, the conclusion might be: "I wonâ€™t try too hard! Iâ€™ll let AI support me!"

Haha, just kidding.

In this conversation, Iâ€™ve roughly found my own capability range. I have a sense of where I stand and know how much further I still have to goâ€”some paths, though, might never be reached. (Got to accept it ðŸ˜…)

Although AI can make you play any role, you will always be yourself.

Only by enhancing our own capabilities can we truly go further.

At least, thatâ€™s what I believe.
