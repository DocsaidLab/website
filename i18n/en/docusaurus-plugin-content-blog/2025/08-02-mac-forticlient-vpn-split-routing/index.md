I previously shared how to modify VPN routes.

- Background: [**Configuring Selective Traffic Routing for VPN**](/en/blog/mac-selective-vpn-routing)

<!-- truncate -->

Back then, the VPN used L2TP mode, and routes could be modified through the `/etc/ppp/ip-up` script.

Later, due to work requirements, I switched to a new VPN tool: **FortiClient**.

Then the original method stopped working.

:::info
FortiClient is a security endpoint solution developed by Fortinet, commonly used for the following purposes:

1. **VPN Connection Tool**
   FortiClient supports SSL VPN and IPSec VPN, enabling users to securely access the company intranet remotely. It can integrate with FortiGate firewall policies to provide enterprise-grade network security and connection control.

2. **Endpoint Protection**
   Besides VPN functionalities, FortiClient also offers malware protection, web filtering, behavior analysis, and other features to enhance the security of user devices.

3. **Integration with Fortinet Ecosystem**
   It integrates with other Fortinet products (such as FortiGate, FortiAnalyzer, EMS) to provide unified security monitoring and management.

4. **Cross-Platform Support**
   FortiClient supports multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android, facilitating unified deployment and management within enterprises.

In short, FortiClient is an enterprise client tool combining remote connectivity and security protection, particularly suitable for organizations that require strict control over internal network access permissions.
:::

## Why did it fail?

FortiClient creates a `utunX` virtual interface on macOS and actively pushes a full set of **default routes**, typically including:

```
0.0.0.0/1      ‚Üí utunX
128.0.0.0/1    ‚Üí utunX
default        ‚Üí utunX
```

These three routes combined mean "all traffic goes through the VPN." Also, every time it connects, it overwrites local settings, so relying on `/etc/ppp/ip-up` alone can no longer accomplish split routing.

What to do? üí¢

It‚Äôs just a VPN tool, yet it wants to take all my traffic?

## So?

This time, my goal is simple, only to satisfy the following conditions:

- **Company intranet** (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`) goes through the VPN
- **Local LAN/general internet** goes directly through the physical network interface (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc.)
- Automatically detect the current VPN interface and local gateway
- Provide validation to ensure the routes really take effect

Below, we first talk about manual commands; the automated script is at the end.

---

## Step 1: Modify routes

FortiClient secretly inserts three forced routes upon connection that pull all traffic into the VPN:

```
0.0.0.0/1
128.0.0.0/1
default
```

These three combined cover the entire IPv4 address space, effectively capturing all your network requests.

So our first step is to delete them:

```bash
for cidr in default 0.0.0.0/1 128.0.0.0/1; do
  sudo route -q -n delete -ifscope "$VPN_IF" "$cidr"
done
```

> `$VPN_IF` is determined by my script to find the interface, such as utun4, utun6, etc.

This step is critical. If you fail to delete these, the VPN will continue intercepting all your traffic. You might see "not in table" messages during deletion; these just mean the route doesn't exist and can be ignored.

---

## Step 2: Restore local default route

After clearing the VPN default routes, we need to restore the original local gateway.

This allows normal internet traffic, like to `google.com` or `youtube.com`, to go through the physical network interfaces (en0, en1, etc.).

```bash
if ! sudo route -n change default "$LOCAL_GW"; then
  sudo route -n add default "$LOCAL_GW"
fi
```

> `$LOCAL_GW` is automatically retrieved from `netstat`, e.g., `192.168.0.1`, no manual input needed.

---

## Step 3: Add intranet-specific route

Next, we handle routing so that only company internal traffic goes through the VPN.

Assuming the intranet is `10.0.0.0/8`, we route it to the VPN‚Äôs peer IP:

```bash
sudo route -n add -net 10.0.0.0/8 "$VPN_PEER"
```

If the route already exists, use `change` instead:

```bash
sudo route -n change -net 10.0.0.0/8 "$VPN_PEER"
```

> `$VPN_PEER` is the VPN point-to-point peer IP, automatically obtained by the script analyzing `ifconfig utunX`.

:::warning
If your intranet is not `10.0.0.0/8`, remember to modify this part accordingly. For example, if your company intranet is `172.16.0.0/12`, adjust it to:

```bash
sudo route -n add -net 172.16.0.0/12 "$VPN_PEER"
```

:::

---

## Step 4: Verify if settings take effect

This final step is my enhancement.

Once you run this script and supply some test targets, it will automatically:

1. Check which interface each IP or hostname actually uses
2. Attempt to ping the target to test connectivity

For example:

Simply run the script with a few test targets, such as:

```bash
bash forticlient_split.sh 10.1.1.1 192.168.0.100 google.com
```

You will get output similar to:

```
üåê 10.1.1.1       ‚Üí interface utun4 (expected utun4) ‚úÖ reachable ‚úÖ
üåê 192.168.0.100  ‚Üí interface en0   (expected local) ‚úÖ reachable ‚úÖ
üåê google.com     ‚Üí interface en0   (expected local) ‚úÖ reachable ‚úÖ
```

This way, you can quickly verify whether your setting of "VPN only handling the company intranet" has taken effect successfully.

Connection, interface, and communication status are all clear at a glance!

Looks pretty good, right?

## Complete script

I have consolidated the full script below, supporting macOS, FortiClient VPN, auto-detection, error prompts, connectivity tests, route printing, and peer IP parsing.

You can save this script as `forticlient_split.sh`, make it executable, and run it directly:

```bash
chmod +x forticlient_split.sh
./forticlient_split.sh 10.1.1.1 192.168.0.100 google.com
```

Here‚Äôs the complete code, enjoy using it:
