description: A brief introduction to NIST and FRVT.
---

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was founded in 1901 and is part of the United States Department of Commerce.

- [**FRVT Official**](https://www.nist.gov/)

As a non-profit organization, NIST's mission is to advance U.S. innovation and competitiveness in science and technology through the development of standards, scientific research, and technology development, thereby promoting economic security and enhancing the quality of life.

## Core Missions and Values of NIST

NIST's core missions include:

- **Measurement Science**: Providing world-class measurement standards that support scientific research, business activities, and public safety.
- **Rigorous Traceability**: Establishing and maintaining a comprehensive system of measurement standards to ensure international traceability and accuracy of measurement results.
- **Standardization and Application**: Promoting the development and implementation of technical standards, particularly in information technology, environmental science, and manufacturing.

NIST's core values emphasize perseverance, integrity, inclusivity, and excellence, which are foundational to its current and future work.

## FRVT Program

The Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) program is a key initiative by NIST.

Its primary goal is to evaluate the performance of facial recognition technologies globally, providing an objective and impartial testing platform.

FRVT encompasses various testing scenarios, including static image recognition and real-time recognition in dynamic environments, thereby helping users and developers comprehensively understand the performance of these technologies in practical applications.

## Importance and Impact of the FRVT Program

The FRVT program significantly influences government agencies, businesses, and other organizations in selecting and deploying facial recognition systems by providing scientifically rigorous testing methods and objective performance assessment data.

These test results not only help determine which technologies best suit specific security needs and operational environments but also foster innovation and advancement in the field of facial recognition technology.

## Participation in the FRVT Program

Participation in the FRVT program involves several steps:

1. **Submission of Participation Agreement**: Developers need to submit a detailed participation agreement to NIST, indicating compliance with all FRVT regulations and standards.
2. **Software Packaging and API Integration**: Participants must encapsulate their algorithms behind the C++ API provided by NIST to ensure compatibility and functionality of the algorithms.
3. **Execution of Verification Suites**: Developers need to run their software through verification suites provided by NIST to ensure that the algorithm outputs submitted can be accurately reproduced by NIST.
4. **Encryption and Data Submission**: All algorithm submissions must be encrypted, correctly signed, and transmitted securely to NIST to ensure data security and integrity.

## FRTE Program and Its Projects

The FRVT program has been split and renamed into Face Recognition Technology Evaluation (FRTE) and Face Analysis Technology Evaluation (FATE).

The FRTE includes several subprojects:

- 1:1 Verification
- 1:N Identification
- Demographic Effects
- Face Mask Effects
- Paperless Travel
- Twins Demonstration

## Conclusion

As a key driver of global standardization and innovation in facial recognition technology, NIST continues to support technological advancements through its FRVT and FRTE programs, ensuring that these advancements not only serve public interests but also meet the needs of business and security.

These initiatives not only enhance the accuracy and reliability of technologies but also promote sustained development across related industries.
