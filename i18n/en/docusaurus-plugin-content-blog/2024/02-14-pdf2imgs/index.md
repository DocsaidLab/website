In daily office tasks or academic endeavors, whether it's for conveniently sharing information or integrating document content into presentations, there's often a need to convert PDF files into image formats.

Here, we recommend a handy Python module: [pdf2image](https://github.com/Belval/pdf2image/tree/master), which can convert PDF files into PIL images.

This tutorial will guide you on how to install and use this package.

## Install Dependencies

`pdf2image` relies on `pdftoppm` and `pdftocairo`, and installation varies slightly across different operating systems:

- **Mac**: Install Poppler via Homebrew: `brew install poppler`.
- **Linux**: Most Linux distributions come pre-installed with `pdftoppm` and `pdftocairo`. If not, install `poppler-utils` via your package manager.
- **Using `conda`**: Poppler can be installed via `conda` on any platform: `conda install -c conda-forge poppler`, then proceed to install `pdf2image`.

## Install `pdf2image`

First, you need to install `pdf2image`. Enter the following command in your terminal to install:

```shell
pip install pdf2image
```

## Convert PDF using `pdf2image`

Converting PDF to images is straightforward:

```python
from pdf2image import convert_from_path

images = convert_from_path('/path/to/your/pdf/file.pdf')
```

This will convert each page of the PDF into a PIL image object and store them in the `images` list.

You can also convert PDF from binary data:

```python
images = convert_from_bytes(open('/path/to/your/pdf/file.pdf', 'rb').read())
```

## Optional Parameters

`pdf2image` provides extensive optional parameters, allowing you to customize DPI, output format, page ranges, etc. For example: use `dpi=300` to enhance the clarity of the output images, or use `first_page` and `last_page` to specify the conversion range.

You can refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/Belval/pdf2image/tree/master) of `pdf2image`; or check our own modified [pdf2imgs](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocsaidKit/blob/eb8ac0a56779a75dcc951c683001e6129052cc5a/docsaidkit/vision/improc.py#L275) function for more usage examples.

## Conclusion

`pdf2image` is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that meets your needs for converting PDF to images. Whether it's for document processing, data organization, or content presentation, it provides an efficient solution.

We hope this tutorial helps you grasp the usage of `pdf2image` effortlessly, enhancing your work and study efficiency.
