This is because the Encoder's primary goal is to capture the main features of the input data and encode them into a fixed-size representation. This representation is typically more concise than the original input and captures its most important information. Due to the simplicity of the architecture, training a pure Encoder is often faster than a full Encoder-Decoder combination, saving training time and resources."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"However, when introducing a Decoder mechanism, the model often requires a larger amount of data for learning. This is because the Decoder must reconstruct the input or generate new output from the fixed representation provided by the Encoder, adding to the model's learning challenge. Large amounts of data provide sufficient examples to help the model learn these complex mappings. The introduction of a Decoder adds complexity to the overall architecture, not only increasing the number of parameters to be trained but also potentially raising the risk of overfitting."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.admonition,{type:"tip",children:(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Could using several orders of magnitude more data on this architecture yield entirely different conclusions?"})}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In summary, VL-T5 provides a valuable starting point, offering new insights into the application of the Encoder-Decoder architecture in vision-and-language integration.
