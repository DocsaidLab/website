The number of features per sample is usually much larger than the number of samples. Thus, using population variance provides a more stable and accurate estimate, especially with small sample sizes.\\n\\n- **Reduced Importance of Unbiased Estimation**\\n\\n  The unbiased nature of sample variance (i.e., dividing by n-1 instead of n) is crucial when estimating population parameters from a sample. However, in deep learning regularization and normalization, like in LayerNorm, the impact of this bias is relatively minor. This is because these computations are used to normalize activations rather than to estimate overall statistics. Using population variance simplifies calculations with minimal effect on training outcomes.\\n\\n- **Stability in Gradient Calculations**\\n\\n  Stable gradients are vital during backpropagation. Using population variance leads to smoother and more stable gradient calculations, avoiding additional noise that might arise from small sample sizes. This contributes to better convergence and training performance.\\n\\n- **Simplified Calculations**\\n\\n  From a computational perspective, calculating population variance is slightly simpler than sample variance because it omits a subtraction operation (i.e., dividing by n rather than n-1). While this isn\'t a decisive factor, it\'s a consideration in the design process.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis article was inspired by a sudden curiosity.\\n\\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the issue for you."},{"id":"nist-and-frvt","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/blog/nist-and-frvt","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2024/06-23-nist-and-frvt/index.md","title":"NIST &

It\'s been several years since I last used Windows.\\n\\n\uff0a\\n\\nWe tried a few methods and finally settled on using PowerShell to set up the Python environment.\\n\\nWe initially thought about using WSL for configuration, but that would turn the environment into a Linux environment... (?)\\n\\nIf we already have a Linux environment at hand, why bother configuring one on Windows?\\n\\n## Operating Environment\\n\\nWe\'re using the virtual environment tool provided by Mac: [**Parallels Desktop**](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/).\\n\\nWith Parallels Desktop, we can smoothly run a Windows system on Mac, and the currently installed one is Windows 11.\\n\\n:::tip\\nThe Apple M1 chip is ARM-based, and it faced many compatibility issues when it was first launched, but it has improved a lot over the years.\\n:::\\n\\n## Installing Chocolatey\\n\\nFirst, we need to launch PowerShell.\\n\\n![PowerShell](./img/img1.jpg)\\n\\nChocolatey is a package manager for Windows. It automates the process of installing, upgrading, and managing software using NuGet and PowerShell technologies. It\'s similar to `apt-get` or `yum` on Linux, allowing Windows users to manage software in a simple and consistent way.\\n\\nInstalling Chocolatey is relatively simple. Just run the following command in PowerShell with administrative privileges:\\n\\n```powershell\\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\'https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1\'))\\n```\\n\\nAfter installation, enter the following command to verify if Chocolatey was installed successfully:\\n\\n```powershell\\nchoco -v\\n```\\n\\nIf you see the version number of Chocolatey, it means the installation was successful.\\n\\n:::tip\\nHere\'s what the above command does:\\n\\n1. **Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force**:\\n\\n   - This command sets the PowerShell execution policy.\\n   - `Set-ExecutionPolicy` is used to change the execution policy to allow or disallow the execution of PowerShell scripts.\\n   - `Bypass` means bypassing all execution policies without any restrictions.\\n   - `-Scope Process` means applying this change only to the current PowerShell session, not affecting the entire system.\\n   - `-Force` is used to forcefully execute this operation without prompting for confirmation.\\n\\n2. **[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072**:\\n\\n   - This command sets the network security protocol.\\n   - `[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol` is used to get or set the protocol type.\\n   - `-bor 3072` adds the TLS 1.2 (3072) protocol to the existing protocols. `-bor` is a bitwise operator, indicating a bitwise OR operation, allowing multiple protocols to be enabled simultaneously.\\n\\n3. **iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\'https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1\'))**:\\n   - This command downloads and executes the Chocolatey installation script.\\n   - `iex` is shorthand for `Invoke-Expression`, used to execute the content passed to it as a string.\\n   - `New-Object System.Net.WebClient` is used to create a new WebClient object, which is used for downloading data.\\n   - `.DownloadString(\'https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1\')` is used to download the script content from the specified URL.\\n   - Overall, the command `iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\'https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1\'))` downloads and immediately executes the PowerShell script located at \'https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1\', which is responsible for installing Chocolatey.\\n\\nIn simple terms, the purpose of this command is: temporarily set the PowerShell execution policy to allow script execution, configure the network security protocol to support TLS 1.2, and then download and execute the Chocolatey installation script.\\n:::\\n\\n:::info\\n**Common Chocolatey Commands:**\\n\\n- **Install**\\n  ```powershell\\n  choco install <packageName>\\n  ```\\n- **Upgrade**\\n  ```powershell\\n  choco upgrade <packageName>\\n  ```\\n- **List installed packages**\\n  ```powershell\\n  choco list --localonly\\n  ```\\n- **Uninstall**\\n  ```powershell\\n  choco uninstall <packageName>\\n  ```\\n  :::\\n\\n## Installing git\\n\\nAfter installation, continue running PowerShell as an administrator, and execute the following command to install Git:\\n\\n```powershell\\nchoco install git -y\\n```\\n\\nAfter installation, enter the following command to verify if Git was installed successfully:\\n\\n```powershell\\ngit --version\\n# >>> git version 2.45.2.windows.1\\n```\\n\\n## Installing Python\\n\\nWe use pyenv to manage Python versions.\\n\\n:::tip\\nAlthough there are many choices on the market, such as Anaconda, Miniconda, WinPython, etc., we still chose pyenv.\\n\\nBecause we often develop on Linux, seeing pyenv feels familiar.\\n:::\\n\\nInstalling and using `pyenv` on Windows is not usually straightforward because `pyenv` is designed for Unix-like environments. However, you can use the `pyenv-win` project, which is a Windows port of `pyenv`.\\n\\nFollow these steps:\\n\\n### Step 1: Installing `pyenv-win`\\n\\n- [**Reference: pyenv-win/docs/installation.md**](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/blob/master/docs/installation.md)\\n\\nDownload the `pyenv-win` project:\\n\\n```powershell\\nInvoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri \\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/master/pyenv-win/install-pyenv-win.ps1\\" -OutFile \\"./install-pyenv-win.ps1\\"; &\\"./install-pyenv-win.ps1\\"\\n```\\n\\nIf you encounter any `UnauthorizedAccess` errors as shown below, please launch Windows PowerShell with the \\"Run as Administrator\\" option and execute:\\n\\n```powershell\\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine\\n```\\n\\nAfter completion, rerun the installation command above.\\n\\n### Step 2: Verify Installation\\n\\n1. **Restart PowerShell**:\\n\\n   - Close and reopen the PowerShell window to apply the environment variable changes.\\n\\n2. **Check `pyenv` installation**:\\n\\n   - Enter the following command to check the `pyenv` version:\\n\\n     ```powershell\\n     pyenv --version\\n     ```\\n\\n### Step 3: Use `pyenv` to install Python versions\\n\\n1. **View available Python versions**:\\n\\n   - List all available Python versions with the following command:\\n\\n     ```powershell\\n     pyenv install --list\\n     ```\\n\\n2. **Install a specific Python version**:\\n\\n- For example, to install Python 3.10.11:\\n\\n  ```powershell\\n  pyenv install 3.10.11\\n  ```\\n\\n3. **Set a global Python version**:\\n\\n   - This step is not necessary, but if you want to use the same Python version across all shells, you can set the installed Python version as the global default:\\n\\n     ```powershell\\n     pyenv global 3.10.11\\n     ```\\n\\n4. **Verify Python installation**:\\n\\n   - Enter the following command to verify if Python was installed successfully:\\n\\n     ```powershell\\n     python --version\\n     ```\\n\\n## Installing VS Code\\n\\nFinally, we install Visual Studio Code as our development tool.\\n\\nHere, we\'ll go to the [**VS Code official website**](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) to download the installer and then proceed with the installation.\\n\\n![VS Code](./img/img2.jpg)\\n\\nAfter installation, we want to be able to use the `code` command directly in PowerShell to open VS Code.\\n\\nSo, we need to add the installation path of VS Code to the environment variables. Copy the following path:\\n\\n```powershell\\nC:\\\\Users\\\\your_user_name\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Microsoft VS Code\\\\bin\\n```\\n\\n:::tip\\nRemember to replace `your_user_name` with your username.\\n:::\\n\\n## Side Note\\n\\nActually, we find the PowerShell display screen really hard to look at.\\n\\nFor this part, we suggest using [**oh-my-posh**](https://ohmyposh.dev/) to beautify the appearance of PowerShell.\\n\\nBut this part is not the focus of this article. Interested readers can check out:\\n\\n- [**Tutorial - Customize Your Prompt with Oh My Posh for PowerShell or WSL**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/tutorials/custom-prompt-setup)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThrough PowerShell, we can quickly set up the Python environment and install development tools.\\n\\nOf course, the above only covers the most basic configurations, leaving this article as a reference."},{"id":"latex-usage","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/blog/latex-usage","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2024/06-04-latex-usage/index.md","title":"LaTeX Syntax Quick

--\x3e\\n\\nIn natural language processing (NLP), it\'s often necessary to compare the similarity of two strings.\\n\\nLevenshtein Similarity is a common measure that assesses the \\"edit distance\\" between two strings, which is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into the other. However, Levenshtein Similarity itself isn\'t intuitive as it depends on the lengths of the strings.\\n\\nTo address this issue, we can normalize Levenshtein Similarity to the [0, 1] range, making it easier to understand and compare the similarity between different strings, known as Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (NLS).\\n\\nAs NLS refers to the similarity between sets of strings, we can further extend it to ANLS, which computes the average similarity among multiple sets of strings, thereby quantifying the performance of a model.\\n\\nAnd then...\\n\\nI always struggle to find implementations that I like, so I decided to write one myself.\\n\\n## Import Necessary Libraries\\n\\nFirst, we need to import some necessary libraries, especially the `EditDistance` implemented by `torchmetrics`:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import Any, Literal, Optional, Sequence, Union\\n\\nimport torch\\nfrom torch import Tensor\\nfrom torchmetrics.metric import Metric\\nfrom torchmetrics.text import EditDistance\\nfrom torchmetrics.utilities.data import dim_zero_cat\\n```\\n\\nSince `EditDistance` can already compute the Levenshtein distance, we can directly use it to calculate the edit distance between two strings. However, `EditDistance` doesn\'t provide normalization functionality, so we need to implement this part ourselves.\\n\\n## Implement Normalization Functionality\\n\\nHere, we inherit the interface of `torchmetrics.metric.Metric`, so we need to implement the `update` and `compute` methods:\\n\\n```python\\nclass NormalizedLevenshteinSimilarity(Metric):\\n\\n    def __init__(\\n        self,\\n        substitution_cost: int = 1,\\n        reduction: Optional[Literal[\\"mean\\", \\"sum\\", \\"none\\"]] = \\"mean\\",\\n        **kwargs: Any\\n    ) -> None:\\n        super().__init__(**kwargs)\\n        self.edit_distance = EditDistance(\\n            substitution_cost=substitution_cost,\\n            reduction=None  # Set to None to get distances for all string pairs\\n        )\\n\\n        # ...\\n```\\n\\nHere are a few key points:\\n\\n1. Ensure that the input `preds` and `target` are lists of strings, otherwise the function will calculate on a character level.\\n2. Calculate the maximum length of each string, so that we can perform normalization.\\n\\n```python\\ndef update(self, preds: Union[str, Sequence[str]], target: Union[str, Sequence[str]]) -> None:\\n    \\"\\"\\"Update state with predictions and targets.\\"\\"\\"\\n\\n    if isinstance(preds, str):\\n        preds = [preds]\\n    if isinstance(target, str):\\n        target = [target]\\n\\n    distances = self.edit_distance(preds, target)\\n    max_lengths = torch.tensor([\\n        max(len(p), len(t))\\n        for p, t in zip(preds, target)\\n    ], dtype=torch.float)\\n\\n    ratio = torch.where(\\n        max_lengths == 0,\\n        torch.zeros_like(distances).float(),\\n        distances.float() / max_lengths\\n    )\\n\\n    nls_values = 1 - ratio\\n\\n    # ...\\n```\\n\\n## Implement the `reduction` Parameter\\n\\nWe also need to accommodate the `reduction` parameter, where if we specify `mean`, it will be the common ANLS score.\\n\\nIn addition to the usual `mean`, we can also use `sum` or `none` to fulfill different needs.\\n\\n```python\\ndef _compute(\\n    self,\\n    nls_score: Tensor,\\n    num_elements: Union[Tensor, int],\\n) -> Tensor:\\n    \\"\\"\\"Compute the ANLS over state.\\"\\"\\"\\n    if nls_score.numel() == 0:\\n        return torch.tensor(0, dtype=torch.int32)\\n    if self.reduction == \\"mean\\":\\n        return nls_score.sum() / num_elements\\n    if self.reduction == \\"sum\\":\\n        return nls_score.sum()\\n    if self.reduction is None or self.reduction == \\"none\\":\\n        return nls_score\\n\\ndef compute(self) -> torch.Tensor:\\n    \\"\\"\\"Compute the NLS over state.\\"\\"\\"\\n    if self.reduction == \\"none\\" or self.reduction is None:\\n        return self._compute(dim_zero_cat(self.nls_values_list), 1)\\n    return self._compute(self.nls_score, self.num_elements)\\n```\\n\\nHere, it\'s noteworthy that when we specify `reduction` as `none`, we need to return all NLS values instead of computing the average. In this case, I referenced the implementation of `torchmetrics.text.EditDistance`, using `dim_zero_cat` to concatenate values in the list together, ensuring that the return value is a `Tensor`.\\n\\n## Complete Implementation\\n\\n:::info\\nWe have synchronized the code to [**DocsaidKit/.../normalized_levenshtein_similarity.py**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocsaidKit/blob/main/docsaidkit/torch/metrics/normalized_levenshtein_similarity.py)\\n:::\\n\\nThe complete implementation is as follows:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import Any, Literal, Optional, Sequence, Union\\n\\nimport torch\\nfrom torch import Tensor\\nfrom torchmetrics.metric import Metric\\nfrom torchmetrics.text import EditDistance\\nfrom torchmetrics.utilities.data import dim_zero_cat\\n\\n\\nclass NormalizedLevenshteinSimilarity(Metric):\\n    \\"\\"\\"\\n    Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (NLS) is a metric that computes the\\n    normalized Levenshtein similarity between two sequences.\\n    This metric is calculated as 1 - (levenshtein_distance / max_length),\\n    where `levenshtein_distance` is the Levenshtein distance between the two\\n    sequences and `max_length` is the maximum length of the two sequences.\\n\\n    NLS aims to provide a similarity measure for character sequences\\n    (such as text), making it useful in areas like text similarity analysis,\\n    Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Natural Language Processing (NLP).\\n\\n    This class inherits from `Metric` and uses the `EditDistance` class to\\n    compute the Levenshtein distance.\\n\\n    Inputs to the ``update`` and ``compute`` methods are as follows:\\n\\n    - ``preds`` (:class:`~Union[str, Sequence[str]]`):\\n        Predicted text sequences or a collection of sequences.\\n    - ``target`` (:class:`~Union[str, Sequence[str]]`):\\n        Target text sequences or a collection of sequences.\\n\\n    Output from the ``compute`` method is as follows:\\n\\n    - ``nls`` (:class:`~torch.Tensor`): A tensor containing the NLS value.\\n        Returns 0.0 when there are no samples; otherwise, it returns the NLS.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        substitution_cost:\\n            The cost of substituting one character for another.

However, delving into JavaScript recently, I\'ve encountered analogous functionalities through commands like `npm`, `npx`, and `nvm`.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nI\'m interested in aligning these commands, hoping it might ease the transition into new skills.\\n\\n## npm vs. pip\\n\\n:::tip\\n**They are both: Package Managers**\\n:::\\n\\nnpm (Node Package Manager) and pip essentially serve the same purpose: they are package managers for Node.js and Python respectively. Package managers are crucial for sharing, reusing, and managing repositories or modules.\\n\\n- **Installing Packages**: In npm, we use the `npm install <package-name>` command to add a library to our project. Similarly, pip achieves the same goal through `pip install <package-name>`.\\n- **Version Control**: npm tracks package versions through the `package.json` file, ensuring that every member of a development team uses the same version of a library. Pip relies on `requirements.txt` or newer tools like pipenv and poetry to achieve similar functionality.\\n- **Package Publishing**: npm enables developers to publish their packages to the npm registry for use by the global Node.js community. Pip provides this capability through PyPI (Python Package Index), allowing the sharing of Python packages.\\n\\n## npx vs. -m Flag\\n\\n:::tip\\n**They are both: Tools for Direct Command Execution**\\n:::\\n\\nnpx (npm package runner) and Python\'s `-m` flag address the need to execute package commands directly in the terminal without global installation.\\n\\n- **Direct Execution**: npx allows you to directly execute any package installed in the project\'s local `node_modules` folder (or fetch it from the npm registry if not installed), while Python achieves similar results through the `-m` flag, allowing direct execution of modules, such as starting a simple HTTP server with `python -m http.server`.\\n\\n:::note\\n**npm run vs. npx run**\\n\\n- npm run: In JavaScript projects, npm run is used to execute scripts defined in the package.json file. This is a common approach to perform project-specific tasks like testing, building, or deploying.\\n- npx run: While npx is typically used to execute single commands or packages, it primarily serves to execute packages not globally installed. npx run is not a standard command; common usage of npx doesn\'t include the keyword \\"run\\" but directly follows with the package name or command.\\n  :::\\n\\n## nvm, pyenv, and conda\\n\\n:::tip\\n**They are all: Version Management Tools**\\n:::\\n\\nSwitching between different versions of Node.js or Python can be cumbersome without proper tools. nvm (Node Version Manager), pyenv, and conda provide solutions to this problem, allowing developers to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js or Python on the same machine.\\n\\n- **Version Switching**: nvm uses commands like `nvm use <version>` to switch Node.js versions. Pyenv and conda offer similar functionalities for Python; pyenv switches versions through `pyenv global <version>` or `pyenv local <version>`, while conda uses `conda activate <environment-name>` to switch to different environments, each capable of having different Python versions and packages.\\n- **Multi-Version Management**: These tools facilitate managing multiple versions on the same machine, addressing potential conflicts due to version discrepancies.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhen learning a new language or framework, I always find it helpful to map it to tools I\'m already familiar with. This practice accelerates my understanding of the new tool\'s functionalities and usage, aiding in a quicker grasp.\\n\\nWhile these commands may not align perfectly, they do share some similarities, hopefully making the transition a bit smoother."},{"id":"vscode-settings","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/blog/vscode-settings","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2024/03-31-vscode-settings/index.md","title":"Common VSCode Configuration Settings","description":"VSCode settings for future reference.","date":"2024-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"vscode","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/vscode"},{"inline":true,"label":"settings","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/settings"}],"readingTime":2.78,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Zephyr","title":"Engineer","url":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh","imageURL":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh.png","key":"Zephyr","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"vscode-settings","title":"Common VSCode Configuration Settings","authors":"Zephyr","tags":["vscode","settings"],"image":"/en/img/2024/0331.webp","description":"VSCode settings for future reference."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Equivalent Basic Commands between Python and JS","permalink":"/en/blog/python-js-basic-command-equivalents"},"nextItem":{"title":"Setting Up Nextcloud Guide","permalink":"/en/blog/setting-up-nextcloud"}},"content":"<figure>\\n![title](/img/2024/0331.webp)\\n<figcaption>Cover Image: Automatically generated by GPT-4 after reading this article.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n---\\n\\nNot long ago, my VSCode settings disappeared for some unknown reason.

/etc/systemd/system/nexcloud.service\\n```\\n\\nPaste the following content:\\n\\n```bash\\n[Unit]\\nDescription=NextCloud Docker Compose\\nRequires=docker.service\\nAfter=docker.service\\n\\n[Service]\\nWorkingDirectory=/home/[YourName]/nextcloud\\nExecStart=/usr/bin/docker compose up --remove-orphans\\nExecStop=/usr/bin/docker compose down\\nRestart=always\\n\\n[Install]\\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\\n```\\n\\n## Starting Nextcloud\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo systemctl enable nextcloud\\nsudo systemctl start nextcloud\\n```\\n\\n## Setting Up Nextcloud\\n\\n1. **Accessing Nextcloud AIO Interface**:\\n\\n   - After initial setup, access Nextcloud AIO interface via `https://ip.address.of.this.server:8080`, replacing `ip.address.of.this.server` with your server\'s IP address.\\n   - It\'s important to use the IP address instead of the domain name to avoid HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) issues.\\n\\n2. **Using Self-Signed Certificates**:\\n\\n   - Accessing port 8080 might use a self-signed certificate, which browsers might flag as untrusted. You\'ll need to manually accept this certificate in your browser to proceed.\\n\\n3. **Automating Certificate Acquisition**:\\n\\n   - If your firewall or router has ports 80 and 8443 open or forwarded and you\'ve pointed a domain to your server, accessing `https://your-domain-that-points-to-this-server.tld:8443` will automatically fetch a trusted certificate from a CA, enhancing security and convenience.\\n\\n4. **Opening Ports for Nextcloud Talk**:\\n\\n   - To ensure Nextcloud Talk features like video calls and messages work, it\'s crucial to open ports 3478/TCP and 3478/UDP for the Talk container in your firewall or router. These ports are essential for handling NAT traversal, a technique allowing devices inside and outside a network to connect directly, crucial for real-time communication applications.\\n\\n- **Common Issues**:\\n\\n  - **Dynamic IP for Home Network**: If you have a dynamic IP, services like No-IP or obtaining a static IP from your ISP might be solutions.\\n  - **Alternative Installation Methods**: You can install Nextcloud directly, but be prepared to handle dependencies on your own.\\n  - **Can\'t Connect After Setup**: If your firewall isn\'t the issue, it might be your router blocking connections.\\n\\n---\\n\\nUpon entering the setup URL, you\'ll find yourself in what can be called an admin panel\'s admin panel.\\n\\n![login_1](./img/login_1.jpg)\\n\\nAt this point, you might panic, realizing you don\'t have a password!\\n\\nTo retrieve the password, use the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo grep password /var/lib/docker/volumes/nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer/_data/data/configuration.json\\n```\\n\\nAfter logging in, you\'ll encounter a setup screen:\\n\\n![login_2](./img/login_2.jpg)\\n\\nThis setup screen reflects my completed configuration. For your first login, enter your prepared domain. The system will prompt you to download additional docker images, which it will then automatically launch.\\n\\nOnce launched, you can start using Nextcloud.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAfter completing the above steps, entering your domain in the address bar will lead you to a beautifully designed interface, your private cloud.\\n\\n![login_3](./img/login_3.jpg)\\n\\nThis interface offers numerous functionalities for file management and sharing. Additionally, you can download the Nextcloud app on your mobile device for file management on-the-go.\\n\\nWith Nextcloud, you no longer need to worry about Google Drive\'s storage limitations."},{"id":"pytorch-training-out-of-memory","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/blog/pytorch-training-out-of-memory","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2024/02-20-pytorch-training-oom/index.md","title":"The Pitfall of Lists in PyTorch","description":"Resolving PyTorch OOM Issues.","date":"2024-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"PyTorch","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/py-torch"},{"inline":true,"label":"OOM","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/oom"}],"readingTime":1.74,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Zephyr","title":"Engineer","url":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh","imageURL":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh.png","key":"Zephyr","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"pytorch-training-out-of-memory","title":"The Pitfall of Lists in PyTorch","authors":"Zephyr","tags":["PyTorch","OOM"],"image":"/en/img/2024/0220.webp","description":"Resolving PyTorch OOM Issues."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Setting Up Nextcloud Guide","permalink":"/en/blog/setting-up-nextcloud"},"nextItem":{"title":"Convert PDF to Images using Python","permalink":"/en/blog/convert-pdf-to-images"}},"content":"<figure>\\n![title](/img/2024/0220.webp)\\n<figcaption>Cover Image: Automatically generated by GPT-4 after reading this article</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs a seasoned PyTorch user, you should be well-versed in techniques for model training, parameter tuning, and optimization.

That\'s what leads to the OOM problem.\\n\\nWe attempted to find related information and it seems this isn\'t a PyTorch issue but rather a Python one.\\n\\nIn essence, refrain from using Lists; use NumPy or Tensors to store data, and you won\'t encounter OOM problems.\\n\\nAt least, that\'s effective in this example.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## I\'ve written code like this, why haven\'t I experienced any issues?\\n\\nThe world is a beautiful place until you encounter a large dataset.\\n\\nBased on my own testing, when the dataset is small, using Lists doesn\'t trigger memory leaks.\\n\\nMore specifically, with just over ten thousand data points, there\'s no issue; but with over a million, it blows up.\\n\\nSo, if your dataset isn\'t large, you might never encounter this problem.\\n\\nAs for the threshold of data size, I\'m unsure. I speculate it\'s a moment of interaction between Python or PyTorch that triggers the anomaly."},{"id":"convert-pdf-to-images","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/blog/convert-pdf-to-images","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2024/02-14-pdf2imgs/index.md","title":"Convert PDF to Images using Python","description":"Using open-source library pdf2image.","date":"2024-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"Python","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/python"},{"inline":true,"label":"pdf2image","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/pdf-2-image"}],"readingTime":1.655,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Zephyr","title":"Engineer","url":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh","imageURL":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh.png","key":"Zephyr","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"convert-pdf-to-images","title":"Convert PDF to Images using Python","authors":"Zephyr","tags":["Python","pdf2image"],"image":"/en/img/2024/0214.webp","description":"Using open-source library pdf2image."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The Pitfall of Lists in PyTorch","permalink":"/en/blog/pytorch-training-out-of-memory"},"nextItem":{"title":"Reading HEIC Images in Python","permalink":"/en/blog/opencv-imread"}},"content":"<figure>\\n![title](/img/2024/0214.webp)\\n<figcaption>Cover Image: Automatically generated by GPT-4 after reading this article.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn daily office tasks or academic endeavors, whether it\'s for conveniently sharing information or integrating document content into presentations, there\'s often a need to convert PDF files into image formats.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nHere, we recommend a handy Python module: [pdf2image](https://github.com/Belval/pdf2image/tree/master), which can convert PDF files into PIL images.\\n\\nThis tutorial will guide you on how to install and use this package.\\n\\n## Install Dependencies\\n\\n`pdf2image` relies on `pdftoppm` and `pdftocairo`, and installation varies slightly across different operating systems:\\n\\n- **Mac**: Install Poppler via Homebrew: `brew install poppler`.\\n- **Linux**: Most Linux distributions come pre-installed with `pdftoppm` and `pdftocairo`.

This function is very convenient as it can read various image formats and directly load the image into a `numpy.ndarray` variable. However, this function is not always universal, and you may encounter some issues.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Basic Usage\\n\\nThe basic usage of the `imread` function is straightforward; you just need to pass the path to the image:\\n\\n```python\\nimport cv2\\n\\nimage = cv2.imread(\'path/to/image.jpg\')\\n```\\n\\nYou can use common image formats such as BMP, JPG, PNG, TIF, and others.\\n\\n## Limitation 1: HEIC Format\\n\\nImages captured on iOS devices are typically in HEIC format, which is not supported in OpenCV. If you try to use the `imread` function to read HEIC format images, you will get a `None` return value.\\n\\nTo address this issue, we need to use the `pyheif` package to read HEIC format images and then convert them into `numpy.ndarray` variables.\\n\\nFirst, install the necessary packages:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo apt install libheif-dev\\npip install pyheif\\n```\\n\\nThen, write a simple function:\\n\\n```python\\nimport cv2\\nimport pyheif\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\ndef read_heic_to_numpy(file_path: str):\\n    heif_file = pyheif.read(file_path)\\n    data = heif_file.data\\n    if heif_file.mode == \\"RGB\\":\\n        numpy_array = np.frombuffer(data, dtype=np.uint8).reshape(\\n            heif_file.size[1], heif_file.size[0], 3)\\n    elif heif_file.mode == \\"RGBA\\":\\n        numpy_array = np.frombuffer(data, dtype=np.uint8).reshape(\\n            heif_file.size[1], heif_file.size[0], 4)\\n    else:\\n        raise ValueError(\\"Unsupported HEIC color mode\\")\\n    return numpy_array\\n\\n\\nimg = read_heic_to_numpy(\'path/to/image.heic\')\\nimg = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)\\n```\\n\\n## Limitation 2: Slow JPG Reading\\n\\nIn some cases, the `imread` function\'s performance in reading JPG format images can be slow. This is because OpenCV uses the `libjpeg` library to read JPG format images, and `libjpeg` itself is not very efficient.\\n\\nHere, we introduce the `TurboJPEG` package, an alternative to `libjpeg` with better performance. We can use `TurboJPEG` to accelerate the reading of JPG format images.\\n\\nSimilarly, install the necessary packages:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo apt install libturbojpeg exiftool\\npip install PyTurboJPEG\\n```\\n\\nThen, let\'s optimize it a bit:\\n\\nGenerally, this can speed up the process by about 2-3 times.\\n\\n```python\\nimport cv2\\nimport piexif\\nfrom enum import IntEnum\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nfrom turbojpeg import TurboJPEG\\n\\n\\njpeg = TurboJPEG()\\n\\n\\nclass ROTATE(IntEnum):\\n    ROTATE_90 = cv2.ROTATE_90_CLOCKWISE\\n    ROTATE_180 = cv2.ROTATE_180\\n    ROTATE_270 = cv2.ROTATE_90_COUNTERCLOCKWISE\\n\\n\\ndef imrotate90(img, rotate_code: ROTATE) -> np.ndarray:\\n    return cv2.rotate(img.copy(), rotate_code)\\n\\n\\ndef get_orientation_code(stream: Union[str, Path, bytes]):\\n    code = None\\n    try:\\n        exif_dict = piexif.load(stream)\\n        if piexif.ImageIFD.Orientation in exif_dict[\\"0th\\"]:\\n            orientation = exif_dict[\\"0th\\"][piexif.ImageIFD.Orientation]\\n            if orientation == 3:\\n                code = ROTATE.ROTATE_180\\n            elif orientation == 6:\\n                code = ROTATE.ROTATE_90\\n            elif orientation == 8:\\n                code = ROTATE.ROTATE_270\\n    finally:\\n        return code\\n\\n\\ndef jpgdecode(byte_: bytes) -> Union[np.ndarray, None]:\\n    try:\\n        bgr_array = jpeg.decode(byte_)\\n        code = get_orientation_code(byte_)\\n        bgr_array = imrotate90(\\n            bgr_array, code) if code is not None else bgr_array\\n    except:\\n        bgr_array = None\\n\\n    return bgr_array\\n\\n\\ndef jpgread(img_file: Union[str, Path]) -> Union[np.ndarray, None]:\\n    with open(str(img_file), \'rb\') as f:\\n        binary_img = f.read()\\n        bgr_array = jpgdecode(binary_img)\\n\\n    return bgr_array\\n\\nimg = jpgread(\'path/to/image.jpg\')\\n```\\n\\nThis way, reading JPG format images can be accelerated.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhat if we want this program to be more intelligent, choosing a suitable way to load images on its own?\\n\\nWe can write a function to select the appropriate loading method based on the image\'s format:\\n\\n```python\\ndef imread(\\n    path: Union[str, Path],\\n    color_base: str = \'BGR\',\\n    verbose: bool = False\\n) -> Union[np.ndarray, None]:\\n\\n    if not Path(path).exists():\\n        raise FileExistsError(f\'{path} can not be found.\')\\n\\n    if Path(path).suffix.lower() == \'.heic\':\\n        img = read_heic_to_numpy(str(path))\\n        img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)\\n    else:\\n        img = jpgread(path)\\n        img = cv2.imread(str(path)) if img is None else img\\n\\n    if img is None:\\n        if verbose:\\n            warnings.warn(\\"Got a None type image.\\")\\n        return\\n\\n    if color_base != \'BGR\':\\n        img = imcvtcolor(img, cvt_mode=f\'BGR2{color_base}\')\\n\\n    return img\\n```\\n\\nFor detailed code, you can refer to: [imread.py](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocsaidKit/blob/eb8ac0a56779a75dcc951c683001e6129052cc5a/docsaidkit/vision/improc.py#L197)\\n\\nAbove are some limitations and solutions regarding OpenCV\'s `imread` function."},{"id":"error-record","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/blog/error-record","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2024/02-04-error-record/index.md","title":"Daily Error Troubleshooting Log","description":"A log of simple issues and their solutions.","date":"2024-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"error","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/error"},{"inline":true,"label":"record","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/record"}],"readingTime":3.36,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Zephyr","title":"Engineer","url":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh","imageURL":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh.png","key":"Zephyr","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"error-record","title":"Daily Error Troubleshooting Log","authors":"Zephyr","tags":["error","record"],"image":"/en/img/2024/0204.webp","description":"A log of simple issues and their solutions."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Reading HEIC Images in Python","permalink":"/en/blog/opencv-imread"},"nextItem":{"title":"User Switching Tool in Containers: gosu","permalink":"/en/blog/gosu-usage"}},"content":"<figure>\\n![title](/img/2024/0204.webp)\\n<figcaption>Cover image: Automatically generated by GPT-4 after reading this article</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n---\\n\\nWe often encounter various issues.

Turbojpeg Warning When Reading Images\\n\\n- **Description**\\n\\n  When reading images, the following warning messages appear:\\n\\n  ```shell\\n  turbojpeg.py:940: UserWarning: Corrupt JPEG data: 18 extraneous bytes before marker 0xc4\\n  turbojpeg.py:940: UserWarning: Corrupt JPEG data: bad Huffman code\\n  turbojpeg.py:940: UserWarning: Corrupt JPEG data: premature end of data segment\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Solution**\\n\\n  To avoid these annoying warnings, you should filter out the problematic images:\\n\\n  ```python\\n  import cv2\\n  import warnings\\n\\n  data = [\'test1.jpg\', \'test2.jpg\', \'test3.jpg\']\\n\\n  for d in data:\\n    with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as w:\\n      warnings.simplefilter(\\"always\\", UserWarning)\\n\\n      # Read the image and see if there are any warnings\\n      cv2.imread(d)\\n\\n      # Remove the data if warnings are present\\n      if w:\\n        data.remove(d)\\n\\n  # Saving the filtered data\\n  ```"},{"id":"gosu-usage","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/blog/gosu-usage","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2024/02-03-usage-gosu/index.md","title":"User Switching Tool in Containers: gosu","description":"A tool worth learning how to use.","date":"2024-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"docker","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/docker"},{"inline":true,"label":"gosu","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/gosu"}],"readingTime":4.055,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Zephyr","title":"Engineer","url":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh","imageURL":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh.png","key":"Zephyr","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"gosu-usage","title":"User Switching Tool in Containers: gosu","authors":"Zephyr","tags":["docker","gosu"],"image":"/en/img/2024/0203.webp","description":"A tool worth learning how to use."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Daily Error Troubleshooting Log","permalink":"/en/blog/error-record"},"nextItem":{"title":"Building a New Computer","permalink":"/en/blog/buy-a-new-computer"}},"content":"<figure>\\n![title](/img/2024/0203.webp)\\n<figcaption>Cover Image: Automatically generated by GPT-4 after reading this article</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n---\\n\\nDocker technology has been extensively employed in deployment and management, allowing developers to package applications and their dependencies together to ensure consistent operation across different environments.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Common Issues\\n\\nHowever, with frequent use, you can\'t escape encountering a few common problems.\\n\\n### TTY Conversion\\n\\nA common scenario is when you output a file within a container, exit the container, and then realize that the file permissions are all set to root. You then have to use `chown` to change the file permissions repeatedly, which can be quite cumbersome.\\n\\n---\\n\\nOr, when running an application within a Docker container using sudo that requires interaction with the terminal (TTY), these applications might fail to properly detect the terminal because sudo might not handle terminal ownership and control properly when creating a new session. As a result, these applications requiring terminal interaction may not run correctly or encounter input/output errors when attempting to use them.\\n\\n### Signal Forwarding\\n\\nSuppose you have a container running a web server like Apache or Nginx. Typically, you might use command-line tools to manage this container, including starting and stopping it. Inside the container, if you use sudo to start the web server, sudo will create a new process to run the web server.\\n\\nThe problem arises when you want to stop or restart the container. The container management system sends signals (like SIGTERM) to the container to notify processes inside it to prepare for shutdown. However, if the web server was started via sudo, this signal might only be sent to the sudo process, not the actual web server process. This means the web server might not receive the stop signal, preventing proper cleanup and safe shutdown.\\n\\n:::tip\\nThe design intention of sudo is to enhance security by allowing regular users to execute commands as other users (usually the root user). In this process, sudo starts a new session to execute the command. While this behavior typically poses no issues in traditional operating system environments, it can lead to signal delivery problems in lightweight virtualized environments like containers, as the new session created by sudo might be incompatible with how the container management system sends signals.\\n:::\\n\\n## What is gosu?\\n\\n- [**gosu GitHub repository**](https://github.com/tianon/gosu)\\n\\ngosu is a tool specifically designed for containers, aiming to simplify and secure command execution within containers. When you need to run a command as a different user (e.g., switching from an administrator to a regular user) within a container, gosu comes in handy. Its core mechanism directly borrows from how `Docker/libcontainer` starts applications within containers (in fact, it directly uses code from the `libcontainer` library for handling `/etc/passwd`).\\n\\nIf you\'re not interested in its inner workings, think of gosu as a helper. When you tell it to \\"run this command as this user,\\" it does just that, then exits, leaving no trace behind.\\n\\n### Practical Use Cases\\n\\nUsing gosu in the ENTRYPOINT script of a Docker container is a typical use case, especially when we need to downgrade from the root user to a non-privileged user to perform certain operations. This practice is crucial for safeguarding the security of the container runtime environment, as it effectively reduces potential security risks.\\n\\nInstalling gosu is straightforward, usually requiring just a few lines in the Dockerfile for installation and configuration. The following example demonstrates how to install gosu in a Dockerfile and dynamically create users and groups using an entrypoint script, then use gosu to execute commands with the specified user identity.\\n\\n```Dockerfile title=\\"Dockerfile\\"\\n# Based on an existing base image\\nFROM some_base_image:latest\\n\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Install gosu\\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gosu && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\\n\\n# Prepare entrypoint script\\nCOPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh\\nRUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh\\n\\nENTRYPOINT [\\"/entrypoint.sh\\"]\\nCMD [\\"default_command\\"]\\n```\\n\\nThe example content of the `entrypoint.sh` script is as follows. It dynamically creates a user and group based on the environment variables USER_ID and GROUP_ID, then executes a command using gosu:\\n\\n```bash title=\\"entrypoint.sh\\"\\n#!/bin/bash\\n# Check if USER_ID and GROUP_ID environment variables are set\\nif [ ! -z \\"$USER_ID\\" ] && [ ! -z \\"$GROUP_ID\\" ]; then\\n    # Create group and user\\n    groupadd -g \\"$GROUP_ID\\" usergroup\\n    useradd -u \\"$USER_ID\\" -g usergroup -m user\\n    # Execute command using gosu\\n    exec gosu user \\"$@\\"\\nelse\\n    exec \\"$@\\"\\nfi\\n```\\n\\nFor a real-world example, refer to: [**DocClassifier training docker**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocClassifier/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile)\\n\\n### Security Considerations\\n\\nWhile gosu\'s primary purpose is to switch from the `root` user to a non-privileged user during container startup, its developers also emphasize potential security risks associated with using gosu in certain contexts.\\n\\nThis is because any tool that allows user switching, if misused, could open doors to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, development and operations teams need to have a thorough understanding of gosu\'s usage scenarios and ensure it is only used in secure environments."},{"id":"buy-a-new-computer","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/blog/buy-a-new-computer","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023/10-12-buy-a-new-computer/index.md","title":"Building a New Computer","description":"Documenting the process of assembling a new computer.","date":"2023-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"rtx4090","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/rtx-4090"},{"inline":true,"label":"13900k","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/13900-k"}],"readingTime":11.075,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Zephyr","title":"Engineer","url":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh","imageURL":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh.png","key":"Zephyr","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"buy-a-new-computer","title":"Building a New Computer","authors":"Zephyr","tags":["rtx4090","13900k"],"image":"/en/img/2023/1012.webp","description":"Documenting the process of assembling a new computer."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"User Switching Tool in Containers: gosu","permalink":"/en/blog/gosu-usage"},"nextItem":{"title":"Managing Python Versions with pyenv","permalink":"/en/blog/pyenv-installation"}},"content":"<figure>\\n![title](/img/2023/1012.webp)\\n<figcaption>Cover Image: Automatically generated by GPT-4 after reading this article</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n---\\n\\nI suddenly decided to buy a new computer.\\n\\nThe main reason?

So we did some research:\\n\\n- Intel 12th Gen pairs with 600 series motherboards, using the 1700 socket.\\n- Intel 13th Gen pairs with 700 series motherboards, using the 1700 socket.\\n- Intel 14th Gen pairs with 700 series motherboards, using the 1700 socket.\\n\\nIt seems that the 1700 socket is a more long-term choice, so we went with a 700 series motherboard:\\n\\n### 1700 Socket\\n\\nAccording to [**Wikipedia\u2019s description of LGA 1700**](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/LGA_1700):\\n\\nLGA 1700 is a socket designed by Intel for its Alder Lake microarchitecture (12th Gen Intel Core) and Raptor Lake microarchitecture (13th and 14th Gen Intel Core) desktop processors, launched in 2021.

That\u2019s a lot of information. In short, we went with the best option and chose a Z790!\\n\\nSpecifications:\\n\\n- Item: GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS ELITE (ATX/Realtek 2.5Gb) 16+1+2 Power Phases\\n- Price: NT$7,990 from the local retailer\\n\\n  ![gigabyte](./img/img3.jpg)\\n\\n## CPU\\n\\nWe\u2019ve heard that Intel\u2019s 13th and 14th Gen CPUs have some peculiar issues.\\n\\nBut since we\u2019re not overclocking, it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. So, we decided to go with the 13th Gen Intel CPU!\\n\\nSpecifications:\\n\\n- Item: Intel i9-13900K \u301024 cores/32 threads\u30113.0GHz-5.8GHz 36MB 1700 Socket 125W\\n- Price: NT$19,500 from the local retailer\\n\\n:::tip\\nWe\u2019re running Ubuntu, and we did experience some crashes initially.\\n\\nHowever, after a system update, the issue disappeared, so we\u2019re not sure if it was a CPU defect.\\n:::\\n\\n## Memory\\n\\nWe believe that the three major memory manufacturers are Micron, Kingston, and Adata. Since we\u2019re not hardcore gamers, we decided to stick with one of these three.\\n\\nCapacity is key here. Since this rig is for model training, filling it up with 128GB is a basic requirement, right?\\n\\nSpecifications:\\n\\n- Item: Kingston 64 GB (Dual Channel 32GBx2) DDR5 6000 CL36 FURY Beast White\\n- Price: NT$6,129 per set from the local retailer\\n- Quantity: 2 sets\\n\\n  ![kingston](./img/img4.jpg)\\n\\n## SSD\\n\\nFor this part, we found a guide from a storage expert on PTT:\\n\\n- [**SSD (Solid State Drive) Purchasing Guide**](https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/PC_Shopping/M.1675587557.A.3D3.html)\\n\\nThere\u2019s a lot of extended reading and comparisons of various manufacturers, but honestly, there\u2019s too much technical knowledge here.\\n\\nWhile we were getting overwhelmed, we seemed to catch a conclusion that recommended Micron, so we went with that! (~Seems a bit too casual?~)\\n\\n---\\n\\nAfter some more research, we concluded that we should avoid QLC SSDs due to their slower write speeds and shorter lifespan. On the other hand, PCIe 5 SSDs seem to have some issues (link below), so we chose TLC technology and PCIe 4.0 SSDs.\\n\\n- [**Crucial, Corsair PCIe 5.0 SSDs running hot, throttling, and shutting down without heatsink**](https://www.neowin.net/news/crucial-corsair-pcie-50-ssds-running-hot-throttling-and-shutting-down-without-heatsink/?fbclid=IwAR0aM7igqoPCImgSMKCtPTNLRw5nOeGJPxLN3HYN89CsTSFEEtl2YsDqbCU)\\n\\n:::tip\\nHowever, technology advances quickly, so these issues might not be a concern in the near future! It\u2019s always best to check the latest information.\\n:::\\n\\n---\\n\\nSince we\u2019re training models, we opted for 4TB of storage to accommodate the datasets.\\n\\nSpecifications:\\n\\n- Item: Micron Crucial P5 Plus 2TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD (Read 6600M / Write 5500M) TLC\\n- Price: NT$3,900 per unit from the local retailer\\n- Quantity: 2 units\\n\\n  ![micron](./img/img5.jpg)\\n\\n## Liquid Cooling\\n\\nIn this category, there are brands like ASUS, MSI, Corsair, and NZXT. Although there seemed to be plenty of choices, we couldn\u2019t find any particularly reliable comparison reviews online, so our focus shifted to warranty duration.\\n\\nMost brands offer a 3-year warranty, but NZXT offers 6+1 years, so we chose NZXT.\\n\\nSpecifications:\\n\\n- Item: NZXT Kraken 360 RGB White\\n- Price: NT$7,990 from the local retailer\\n- Thickness: 5.6 cm\\n\\n  ![nzxt](./img/img6.jpg)\\n\\n:::tip\\nIf you\u2019re an expert in this field, feel free to provide us with more professional advice. We\u2019ll prioritize it when building our next rig.\\n:::\\n\\n## Case and Fans\\n\\nFor this part, we just chose a case that could fit everything and then bought some additional fans to install.\\n\\nSpecifications:\\n\\n- Items:\\n  - ASUS TUF Gaming GT502 White ATX\\n  - TUF Gaming TF120 ARGB White Triple Fan Pack (Case Gift) x1\\n  - TUF Gaming TF120 ARGB White Triple Fan Pack (Additional Purchase) x1\\n  - TUF Gaming TF120 ARGB White Single Fan (Additional Purchase) x4\\n- Prices:\\n\\n  - Case with Gift: NT$5,490 from the local retailer\\n  - Additional Triple Fan Pack: NT$1,690 per set from the local retailer\\n  - Additional Single Fan: NT$549 per fan from the local retailer\\n\\n    ![asus case](./img/img7.jpg)\\n\\n## Power Supply Unit\\n\\nFor this part, we just searched online for recommended power supply brands of the year.\\n\\nAny brand that appeared on the lists seemed reliable to us, so we focused on warranty duration and price and went with FSP.\\n\\nSpecifications:\\n\\n- Item: FSP HYDRO PTM PRO 1200W ATX3.0 Platinum Fully Modular\\n- Price: NT$5,790 from the local retailer\\n\\n  ![fsp](./img/img8.jpg)\\n\\n---\\n\\nContinuing the discussion about the GPU, we need to add some information about the ATX 3.0 standard:\\n\\n- [**ATX 3.0 Standard**](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/ATX%E8%A6%8F%E6%A0%BC)\\n\\n  The ATX 3.0 standard was released in February 2022. It includes a new 16-Pin 12VHPWR power interface, capable of delivering up to 600W of power to the graphics card. These components contain data lines used to negotiate power functions with the power supply unit, ensuring they do not consume more power than the PSU can provide. The standard also has stricter requirements for handling power spikes.\\n\\nTo meet the power demands of the RTX 4090, it\u2019s important to consider ATX 3.0 compatibility when selecting a power supply. Shortly after the RTX 4090\u2019s release, many cases of power issues were reported, mostly due to insufficient power supply, causing instability in the system.\\n\\n## Completion\\n\\nAfter buying all these components, we weren\u2019t entirely confident in our ability to assemble everything correctly, so we entrusted the final assembly to a technician at the store. Our photography skills aren\u2019t great, but you can check out the video below to see what the final product looks like\u2014it\u2019s quite similar, except our graphics card and all four memory sticks are also white.\\n\\n- [**ASUS TUF GT502 CUSTOM SETUP | Black & White PC BUILD | i9-13900k | ASUS TUF RTX 4070TI | ProArt Z790**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puMYF4wpzTQ)\\n\\n  ![final](./img/img9.jpg)\\n\\n---\\n\\nThat wraps up the assembly process. Now it\u2019s time to enjoy training some models with our new rig!"},{"id":"pyenv-installation","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/blog/pyenv-installation","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023/10-10-pyenv-installation/index.md","title":"Managing Python Versions with pyenv","description":"Documenting the installation and usage of pyenv.","date":"2023-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"pyenv","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/pyenv"},{"inline":true,"label":"virtualenv","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/virtualenv"}],"readingTime":2.365,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Zephyr","title":"Engineer","url":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh","imageURL":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh.png","key":"Zephyr","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"pyenv-installation","title":"Managing Python Versions with pyenv","authors":"Zephyr","tags":["pyenv","virtualenv"],"image":"/en/img/2023/1010.webp","description":"Documenting the installation and usage of pyenv."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Building a New Computer","permalink":"/en/blog/buy-a-new-computer"},"nextItem":{"title":"Recording Model Training Environment Issues","permalink":"/en/blog/python-env-info-collector"}},"content":"<figure>\\n![title](/img/2023/1010.webp)\\n<figcaption>Cover Image: Automatically generated by GPT-4 after reading this article.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn earlier years, Conda was predominantly used for managing Python environments. Nowadays, pyenv is commonly employed.\\n\\nThis article aims to document the installation and usage of pyenv.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\nBefore installing `pyenv`, ensure that `Git` is installed on your system.\\n\\n:::info\\nThe pyenv package provides a [**Common build problems guide**](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems) to address installation issues.\\n\\nIf you encounter any problems during installation, refer to this page.\\n:::\\n\\n## Installing `pyenv`\\n\\n1. **Execute Installation Command**:\\n\\n   You can quickly install `pyenv` by running the following command:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   curl https://pyenv.run | bash\\n   ```\\n\\n   This command fetches and executes the installation script from the `pyenv-installer` repository on GitHub.\\n\\n2. **Configure Your Shell Environment**:\\n\\n   After installation, follow the [**setup guide**](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv) to configure your shell environment to ensure that `pyenv` works correctly.\\n\\n   If you are using `bash`, add the following code to your `.bashrc` file:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   export PATH=\\"$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH\\"\\n   eval \\"$(pyenv init --path)\\"\\n   eval \\"$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n   For `zsh` users, add the above code to your `.zshrc` file.\\n\\n3. **Restart Your Shell**:\\n\\n   After completing the above steps, reload the new configuration.\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   exec $SHELL\\n   ```\\n\\n## Using `pyenv`\\n\\nOnce installed and configured, you can start using `pyenv` to manage multiple Python versions:\\n\\n- **Install a New Python Version**:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  pyenv install 3.10.14\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Switch the Global Python Version**:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  pyenv global 3.10.14\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Use a Specific Version in a Directory**:\\n  ```bash\\n  pyenv local 3.8.5\\n  ```\\n\\n## Virtual Environments\\n\\nVirtual environments are crucial in Python development.\\n\\nThey allow us to use different Python versions and dependencies in different projects.\\n\\nAt the very least, when you accidentally mess up your Python environment, you can simply delete the virtual environment and start over.\\n\\n:::tip\\nIt\'s highly recommended to use virtual environments when developing Python projects.\\n:::\\n\\n### Installation\\n\\n`pyenv` also provides a `pyenv-virtualenv` plugin, making it easier to manage Python virtual environments.\\n\\nPreviously, this feature required separate installation, but it\'s now integrated into `pyenv`, and we can directly use:\\n\\n```bash\\npyenv virtualenv 3.10.14 your-env-name\\n```\\n\\nHere, `3.10.14` is the Python version you want to use, which you\'ve already installed in the previous step, and `your-env-name` is the name of the virtual environment.\\n\\n### Usage\\n\\nTo activate the virtual environment, run:\\n\\n```bash\\npyenv activate your-env-name\\n```\\n\\n### Removal\\n\\nFinally, when you no longer need the virtual environment, you can run the following command to delete it:\\n\\n```bash\\npyenv virtualenv-delete your-env-name\\n```\\n\\n## Updating `pyenv`\\n\\nTo update `pyenv` to the latest version, simply run:\\n\\n```bash\\npyenv update\\n```\\n\\n## Uninstalling `pyenv`\\n\\nIf you decide to no longer use `pyenv`, follow these steps to uninstall:\\n\\n1. **Remove the `pyenv` Installation Directory**:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   rm -fr ~/.pyenv\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Clean Your `.bashrc`**:\\n   Remove or comment out the relevant `pyenv` configuration lines, then restart your shell:\\n   ```bash\\n   exec $SHELL\\n   ```"},{"id":"python-env-info-collector","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/blog/python-env-info-collector","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023/09-22-python-env-info-collector/index.md","title":"Recording

While it\'s not exhaustive, it should suffice for basic troubleshooting needs.\\n\\nTypically, we record environment information in the training host\'s logs at the start of training.\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nLet\'s start by installing the necessary packages:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install psutil requests\\n```\\n\\nNext, you can retrieve the complete code at the end of this article and integrate it into your project.\\n\\n## `get_package_versions`\\n\\nAssuming you have installed `docsaidkit` and it\'s already in your project, you can test it with the following command:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom docsaidkit import get_package_versions\\n\\nget_package_versions()\\n```\\n\\nUpon execution, you\'ll receive the following result:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"PyTorch Version\\": \\"2.1.1+cu121\\",\\n  \\"PyTorch Lightning Version\\": \\"2.1.2\\",\\n  \\"TensorFlow Error\\": \\"No module named \'tensorflow\'\\",\\n  \\"Keras Error\\": \\"No module named \'keras\'\\",\\n  \\"NumPy Version\\": \\"1.24.4\\",\\n  \\"Pandas Version\\": \\"2.0.3\\",\\n  \\"Scikit-learn Version\\": \\"1.3.2\\",\\n  \\"OpenCV Version\\": \\"4.8.1\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- PyTorch Version: PyTorch version\\n- PyTorch Lightning Version: PyTorch Lightning version\\n- TensorFlow Error: TensorFlow version\\n- Keras Error: Keras version\\n- NumPy Version: NumPy version\\n- Pandas Version: Pandas version\\n- Scikit-learn Version: Scikit-learn version\\n- OpenCV Version: OpenCV version\\n\\n## `get_gpu_cuda_versions`\\n\\nTest program:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom docsaidkit import get_gpu_cuda_versions\\n\\nget_gpu_cuda_versions()\\n```\\n\\nUpon execution, you\'ll receive the following result:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"CUDA Version\\": \\"12.1\\",\\n  \\"NVIDIA Driver Version\\": \\"535.129.03\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- CUDA Version: CUDA version\\n- NVIDIA Driver Version: NVIDIA driver version\\n\\n## `get_system_info`\\n\\nTest program:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom docsaidkit import get_system_info\\n\\nget_system_info()\\n```\\n\\nUpon execution, you\'ll receive the following result:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"OS Version\\": \\"Linux-6.2.0-37-generic-x86_64-with-glibc2.34\\",\\n  \\"CPU Model\\": \\"13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-13900K\\",\\n  \\"Physical CPU Cores\\": 24,\\n  \\"Logical CPU Cores (incl. hyper-threading)\\": 32,\\n  \\"Total RAM (GB)\\": 125.56,\\n  \\"Available RAM (GB)\\": 110.9,\\n  \\"Disk Total (GB)\\": 1832.21,\\n  \\"Disk Used (GB)\\": 188.94,\\n  \\"Disk Free (GB)\\": 1550.12,\\n  \\"GPU Info\\": \\"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090\\",\\n  \\"IPV4 Address\\": [\\"192.168.---.---\\"],\\n  \\"IPV4 Address (External)\\": \\"---.---.---.---\\",\\n  \\"MAC Address\\": [\\"--.--.--.--.--.--\\"]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- OS Version: Operating system version\\n- CPU Model: CPU model\\n- Physical CPU Cores: Number of physical CPU cores\\n- Logical CPU Cores (incl. hyper-threading): Number of logical CPU cores (including hyper-threading)\\n- Total RAM (GB): Total RAM capacity (GB)\\n- Available RAM (GB): Available RAM capacity (GB)\\n- Disk Total (GB): Total disk capacity (GB)\\n- Disk Used (GB): Used disk capacity (GB)\\n- Disk Free (GB): Free disk capacity (GB)\\n- GPU Info: GPU information\\n- IPV4 Address: Internal IPV4 address\\n- IPV4 Address (External): External IPV4 address\\n- MAC Address: MAC address\\n\\n## Considerations and Alternatives\\n\\nSince we\'re writing this function on Ubuntu, there might be unexpected developments on other operating systems.\\n\\nHere are a few points to note:\\n\\n- Due to OS limitations, some functions may not run on all platforms. For example, `get_cpu_info` won\'t display the complete CPU model on Windows. In such cases, consider using other tools or manually obtaining this information.\\n- If you\'re on Windows, you can\'t directly use `nvidia-smi` to get GPU information. Make sure you have NVIDIA drivers and related tools installed and execute it in a command prompt window.\\n- External IP address is fetched from `https://httpbin.org/ip`, so ensure an active internet connection.\\n\\n## Code\\n\\nWe hope this code helps you quickly inspect your training environment. You can output this information and save it along with your model\'s training logs to ensure traceability and reproducibility.\\n\\n- [system_info.py](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocsaidKit/blob/main/docsaidkit/utils/system_info.py)\\n\\n```python showLineNumbers\\nimport platform\\nimport socket\\nimport subprocess\\n\\nimport psutil\\nimport requests\\n\\n\\ndef get_package_versions():\\n    \\"\\"\\"\\n    Get versions of commonly used packages in deep learning and data science.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n        dict: Dictionary containing versions of installed packages.\\n    \\"\\"\\"\\n    versions_info = {}\\n\\n    #

This not only provides better version control but also ensures the security of software packages.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nIn this article, we\'ll use Docker to set up a PyPi Server and run it on Ubuntu.\\n\\nWe assume you\'ve already installed Docker on Ubuntu and are familiar with basic Docker operations.\\n\\n## 1. Pull the pypiserver Docker Image\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker pull pypiserver/pypiserver:latest\\n```\\n\\n## 2. Create a Directory to Store Python Packages\\n\\nWithout further ado, let\'s create a directory to store Python packages in the home directory.\\n\\n```bash\\nmkdir ~/packages\\n```\\n\\n## 3. Set Up htpasswd\\n\\nhtpasswd is a file format used to store usernames and passwords (often used for basic HTTP authentication).\\n\\npypiserver uses this file to authenticate users attempting to upload or download packages. It\'s a simple yet effective way to enhance the security of pypiserver.\\n\\nTo create a `.htpasswd` file, you need the `apache2-utils` package:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo apt install apache2-utils\\n```\\n\\nThen, use the following command to create a new `.htpasswd` file:\\n\\n```bash\\nhtpasswd -c ~/.htpasswd [username]\\n```\\n\\nIt will prompt you to enter a password for `username`. After entering the password, the `.htpasswd` file will be created in your home directory.\\n\\nNow, you can use the `docker run` command mentioned above to run `pypiserver` and authenticate using the `.htpasswd` file you just created.\\n\\n## 4. Mount pypiserver as a Background Service\\n\\nTo run the Docker container as a background service, we can use Docker Compose and Systemd.\\n\\n### 4.1 Install Docker Compose\\n\\nIf you haven\'t installed Docker Compose yet, install it first by referring to the [official Docker Compose installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).\\n\\nIt\'s worth noting that Docker Compose has undergone significant updates recently, with many changes in usage compared to before. The most obvious change is the shift from using `docker-compose` commands to `docker compose` commands.\\n\\nFollowing the official documentation, here\'s how you can install the latest version of Docker Compose:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo apt update\\nsudo apt install docker-compose-plugin\\n```\\n\\nCheck if Docker Compose is installed correctly:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker compose version\\n```\\n\\n### 4.2 Create Files\\n\\nCreate a `docker-compose.yml` file somewhere and fill it with the following content:\\n\\nYou can also refer to the template provided by `pypiserver`: [**docker-compose.yml**](https://github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)\\n\\n```yaml\\nversion: \\"3.3\\"\\nservices:\\n  pypiserver:\\n    image: pypiserver/pypiserver:latest\\n    volumes:\\n      - /home/[your_username]/auth:/data/auth\\n      - /home/[your_username]/packages:/data/packages\\n    command: run -P /data/auth/.htpasswd -a update,download,list /data/packages\\n    ports:\\n      - \\"8080:8080\\"\\n```\\n\\n- Replace `[your_username]` with your actual username in the above configuration.\\n- You can modify the external port mapping here, for example, change it to: `\\"18080:8080\\"`.\\n\\n### 4.3 Create Systemd Service\\n\\nCreate a configuration file:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo vim /etc/systemd/system/pypiserver.service\\n```\\n\\nAdd the following content:\\n\\n```bash\\n[Unit]\\nDescription=PypiServer Docker Compose\\nRequires=docker.service\\nAfter=docker.service\\n\\n[Service]\\nWorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/docker-compose/directory\\nExecStart=/usr/bin/docker compose up --remove-orphans\\nExecStop=/usr/bin/docker compose down\\nRestart=always\\n\\n[Install]\\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\\n```\\n\\n- Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/docker-compose/directory` with the actual path to the `docker-compose.yml` file, specifying only the directory, not the filename.\\n- Make sure your Docker path is correct, you can use `which docker` to confirm.\\n- We\'re using the new `docker compose` commands instead of `docker-compose`.\\n\\n### 4.4 Start the pypiserver Service\\n\\nTell systemd to reload the new service configuration:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\\n```\\n\\nStart the service:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo systemctl start pypiserver.service\\nsudo systemctl enable pypiserver.service\\n```\\n\\nNow, `pypiserver` will run as a `systemd` service and automatically start each time the host boots up.\\n\\n## 5. Check Status\\n\\nIf you want to check the current status of the service, you can use:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo systemctl status pypiserver.service\\n```\\n\\nThis will display the current status of the `pypiserver` service, including whether it\'s running and recent log outputs.\\n\\n![pypiserver status](./img/pypiserver.jpg)\\n\\n## 6. Using pypiserver\\n\\nNow, you can use `pip` to install and upload packages.\\n\\n### 6.1 Upload Packages\\n\\nFirst, you need a packaged Python software package (usually in .whl or .tar.gz format). Suppose you already have a package named `example_package-0.1-py3-none-any.whl`.\\n\\nTo upload the software package to your `pypiserver`, use `twine`:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install twine\\ntwine upload --repository-url http://localhost:8080/ example_package-0.1-py3-none-any.whl\\n```\\n\\n- Ensure that `localhost:8080` is the address and port of your pypiserver service.\\n\\n### 6.2 Install Packages\\n\\nTo install packages, use `pip` and specify the address and port of your `pypiserver` service:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install --index-url http://localhost:8080/ example_package\\n```\\n\\n### 6.3 Use Basic Authentication\\n\\nIf your pypiserver is configured with basic authentication (which may be done for security reasons), you need to provide authentication information when uploading or downloading:\\n\\n- Uploading packages:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  twine upload --repository-url http://localhost:8080/ --username [username] --password [password] example_package-0.1-py3-none-any.whl\\n  ```\\n\\n- Installing packages:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  pip install --index-url http://[username]:[password]@localhost:8080/ example_package\\n  ```\\n\\n### 6.4 Configure pip.conf for Long-Term Use\\n\\nIf you frequently install packages from this server, you may not want to specify `--index-url` every time you use `pip install`. In this case, you can set default package index sources in `pip.conf`.\\n\\nFirst, find or create a `pip.conf` file. Here are the files that might exist on your machine in order of precedence:\\n\\n- Priority 1: Site-level configuration file:\\n\\n  - `/home/[your_username]/.pyenv/versions/3.8.18/envs/main/pip.conf`\\n\\n- Priority 2: User-level configuration files:\\n\\n  - `/home/[your_username]/.pip/pip.conf`\\n  - `/home/[your_username]/.config/pip/pip.conf`\\n\\n- Priority 3: Global-level configuration files:\\n\\n  - `/etc/pip.conf`\\n  - `/etc/xdg/pip/pip.conf`\\n\\nSo make sure to clarify which Python environment is using which file, and once you\'ve found or created the file, add the following content:\\n\\n```bash\\n[global]\\nindex-url = http://[your_server_IP]:8080/\\ntrusted-host = [your_server_IP]\\n```\\n\\nAgain, ensure to replace `[your_server_IP]:8080` with the correct address and port of your `pypiserver`.\\n\\nFrom now on, when you use `pip install [package_name]`, `pip` will automatically use the server address configured in `pip.conf` as the package source.\\n\\n## 7. Conclusion\\n\\nCongratulations! You\'ve successfully set up your own private PyPI server and learned how to upload and download packages.\\n\\nWith `pypiserver`, you can efficiently manage your Python packages and ensure they\'re in a secure environment. I hope this article proves to be practically helpful for you."},{"id":"ubuntu-install-ssh","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/blog/ubuntu-install-ssh","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023/09-12-ubuntu-install-ssh/index.md","title":"Setting Up SSH Server on Ubuntu","description":"Tutorial on configuring ssh server.","date":"2023-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ubuntu","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/ubuntu"},{"inline":true,"label":"ssh","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/ssh"}],"readingTime":1.775,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Zephyr","title":"Engineer","url":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh","imageURL":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh.png","key":"Zephyr","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"ubuntu-install-ssh","title":"Setting Up SSH Server on Ubuntu","authors":"Zephyr","tags":["ubuntu","ssh"],"image":"/en/img/2023/0912.webp","description":"Tutorial on configuring ssh server."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Setting Up PyPiServer on Ubuntu","permalink":"/en/blog/setting-up-pypiserver-on-ubuntu-with-docker"},"nextItem":{"title":"Automating GitHub Runner with Systemd","permalink":"/en/blog/ubuntu-github-runner-systemd"}},"content":"<figure>\\n![title](/img/2023/0912.webp)\\n<figcaption>Cover image: Automatically generated by GPT-4 after reading this article.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n---\\n\\nSSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that allows users to securely access and manage remote servers.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThis guide will walk you through setting up passwordless login.\\n\\n## 1. Install OpenSSH Server\\n\\nOpen a terminal.\\n\\nEnter the following commands to install the OpenSSH server:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo apt update\\nsudo apt install openssh-server\\n```\\n\\n## 2. Check SSH Server Status\\n\\nUse the following command to check the status of the SSH server:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo systemctl status ssh\\n```\\n\\nIf you see \\"Active: active (running)\\", then the SSH server has been successfully started.\\n\\n## 3. Configure SSH Passwordless Login:\\n\\n### 3.1 Generate SSH Key Pair on the Client\\n\\nOpen a terminal.\\n\\nEnter the following command to generate a key pair:\\n\\n```bash\\nssh-keygen\\n```\\n\\nFollow the prompts. The default settings are usually sufficient. You can press Enter when prompted for a passphrase to create a passphrase-less key pair.\\n\\n### 3.2 Copy the Public Key to the Server\\n\\nUse the `ssh-copy-id` command to copy the public key to the server. Replace `[username]` and `[server-ip]` with your server details.\\n\\n```bash\\nssh-copy-id [username]@[server-ip]\\n```\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```bash\\nssh-copy-id john@192.168.0.100\\n```\\n\\nIf the server is using a non-default SSH port (e.g., 2222), use the `-p` parameter:\\n\\n```bash\\nssh-copy-id -p 2222 john@192.168.0.100\\n```\\n\\nThis command will prompt you for the server\'s password.\\n\\nOnce the authentication is successful, your public key will be added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server.\\n\\n### 3.3 Test Passwordless Login\\n\\nTry SSHing into the server:\\n\\n```bash\\nssh [username]@[server-ip]\\n```\\n\\nIf everything is configured correctly, you should be able to log in to the server without a password.\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\nUsing SSH key authentication indeed enhances security and convenience, but make sure not to lose your private key.\\n\\nIt\'s recommended to regularly rotate or update your SSH keys. For added security, consider disabling password authentication.\\n\\nThis can be configured in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on the server:\\n\\n- `PasswordAuthentication no`.\\n\\nOnce you\'ve completed the above steps, you\'ll be able to log in to the server from the client without a password using SSH key authentication."},{"id":"ubuntu-github-runner-systemd","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/blog/ubuntu-github-runner-systemd","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023/09-10-ubuntu-github-action-runner-systemd/index.md","title":"Automating GitHub Runner with Systemd","description":"Running automatically with Ubuntu Systemd.","date":"2023-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"github-action","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/github-action"},{"inline":true,"label":"runner","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/runner"}],"readingTime":2.235,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Zephyr","title":"Engineer","url":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh","imageURL":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh.png","key":"Zephyr","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"ubuntu-github-runner-systemd","title":"Automating GitHub Runner with Systemd","authors":"Zephyr","tags":["github-action","runner"],"image":"/en/img/2023/0910.webp","description":"Running automatically with Ubuntu Systemd."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Setting Up SSH Server on Ubuntu","permalink":"/en/blog/ubuntu-install-ssh"},"nextItem":{"title":"Logging into RTF8207W Router","permalink":"/en/blog/login-rtf8207w"}},"content":"<figure>\\n![title](/img/2023/0910.webp)\\n<figcaption>Cover Image: Automatically generated by GPT-4 after reading this article</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn our collaborative work using GitHub, we often utilize private hosts for CI/CD tasks. While GitHub provides documentation on how to install runners, following those steps might lead to instances where the host is rebooted, but the runner fails to start again.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThis issue often slips through the cracks until someone notices the CI/CD isn\'t responding, prompting the reminder to manually start the service.\\n\\n**This cycle of forgetfulness is disruptive!**\\n\\nHence, automation is needed!\\n\\n- Documentation Illustration\\n\\n  ![github_set_runner](./img/github_set_runner.jpg)\\n\\n## Configuration Process\\n\\nTo automatically execute a task after the host boots up, systemd service can be employed.\\n\\n1. **Create a new systemd service file:**\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/actions-runner.service\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Paste the following content into the file:**\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   [Unit]\\n   Description=GitHub Action Runner\\n   After=network.target\\n\\n   [Service]\\n   Type=simple\\n   User=your_username\\n   WorkingDirectory=/home/your_username/actions-runner\\n   ExecStart=/home/your_username/actions-runner/run.sh\\n   Restart=always\\n   RestartSec=5\\n\\n   [Install]\\n   WantedBy=multi-user.target\\n   ```\\n\\n   _Note: Replace `User` and `WorkingDirectory` with your own username._\\n\\n3. **Inform systemd to reload the service configurations:**\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo systemctl daemon-reload\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Enable this service to start automatically during boot-up:**\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo systemctl enable actions-runner.service\\n   ```\\n\\n5. **Now you can manually start this service or test it by rebooting:**\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo systemctl start actions-runner.service\\n   ```\\n\\n   Using this method, the `actions-runner` will execute in the background upon booting up your host.\\n\\n   If you wish to stop the service, you can use the following command:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo systemctl stop actions-runner.service\\n   ```\\n\\n   _Note: Ensure `run.sh` has executable permissions._\\n\\n## Checking Status\\n\\nWhen managing services with systemd, you can\'t directly \\"attach\\" to a service to view its output. However, you can check the service\'s logs to understand its operational status. To view the logs of the `actions-runner` service, you can use the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo journalctl -u actions-runner.service -f\\n```\\n\\nExplanation:\\n\\n- `-u actions-runner.service`: Only view logs for the service named `actions-runner`.\\n- `-f`: This parameter allows `journalctl` to continuously track the latest logs, enabling you to see real-time output.\\n\\nFurthermore, if you want to check the current status of the service, you can use:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo systemctl status actions-runner.service\\n```\\n\\nThis will display the current status of the `actions-runner` service, including whether it\'s running and recent log outputs:\\n\\n![action-service](./img/action-service.jpg)\\n\\n## Reconfiguration\\n\\nIf the original runner is lost, it\'s typically due to switching between public and private repositories, or if the runner hasn\'t been invoked for a long time. In any case, the original runner is lost, necessitating reconfiguration.\\n\\nIn such cases, navigate to the `actions-runner` directory, delete the `.runner` file, and then rerun:\\n\\n```bash\\n./config.sh --url ... (replace with new token configuration)\\n```\\n\\nThe remaining process remains the same. After configuration, restart the service, and you\'re good to go."},{"id":"login-rtf8207w","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/blog/login-rtf8207w","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023/09-04-login-rtf8207w/index.md","title":"Logging into RTF8207W Router","description":"RTF8207W account and password.","date":"2023-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"rtf8207w","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/rtf-8207-w"}],"readingTime":0.825,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Zephyr","title":"Engineer","url":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh","imageURL":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh.png","key":"Zephyr","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"login-rtf8207w","title":"Logging into RTF8207W Router","authors":"Zephyr","tags":["rtf8207w"],"image":"/en/img/2023/0904.webp","description":"RTF8207W account and password."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Automating GitHub Runner with Systemd","permalink":"/en/blog/ubuntu-github-runner-systemd"},"nextItem":{"title":"Fail2ban: Protecting SSH Service","permalink":"/en/blog/fail2ban-settings"}},"content":"<figure>\\n![title](/img/2023/0904.webp)\\n<figcaption>Cover Image: Automatically generated by GPT-4 after reading the article.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n---\\n\\nToday, we\'re going to talk about logging into Chunghwa Telecom\'s little turtle, the RTF8207W modem.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nFirst off, the actual device doesn\'t look anything like the cover image; that\'s just a figment of GPT\'s imagination.\\n\\nBut I digress, let\'s get back to it:\\n\\n### 1.

Let\'s set it up quickly:\\n\\n- Malicious Attack Illustration\\n\\n  ![attack from ssh](./img/ban_1.jpg)\\n\\n## 1. Installation of Fail2ban\\n\\n**Fail2ban** is software designed to protect servers from brute force attacks. It automatically adjusts firewall rules to block attackers\' IP addresses when suspicious behavior, such as repeated login failures, occurs.\\n\\nOn most Linux distributions, you can install Fail2ban using package management tools.\\n\\nOn Ubuntu, you can use apt to install:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo apt install fail2ban\\n```\\n\\n## 2. Configuration\\n\\nThe configuration file is located at `/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf`.\\n\\nIt\'s recommended not to modify this file directly but to make a copy named `jail.local` and edit it:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local\\n```\\n\\nEdit `jail.local`:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local\\n```\\n\\n**Important configuration parameters:**\\n\\n- **ignoreip:** Ignored IP addresses or networks, e.g., 127.0.0.1/8\\n- **bantime:** Duration of the ban in seconds (default is 600 seconds)\\n- **findtime:** How many failures within this time frame (default is 600 seconds)\\n- **maxretry:** Maximum number of failed attempts allowed within findtime.\\n\\n## 3. Start and Monitor\\n\\nStart Fail2ban:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo service fail2ban start\\n```\\n\\nCheck Fail2ban\'s status:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo fail2ban-client status\\n```\\n\\n## 4. Adding Custom Rules\\n\\nIf you want to set specific rules for particular services (e.g., SSH or Apache), you can add or modify corresponding sections in `jail.local`, for example, SSH settings:\\n\\n```bash\\n[sshd]\\nenabled = true\\nport = ssh\\nfilter = sshd\\nlogpath = /var/log/auth.log\\nmaxretry = 3\\n```\\n\\n## 5. Testing\\n\\nAfter making configuration changes, restart Fail2ban to apply the changes:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo service fail2ban restart\\n```\\n\\nThen, from another machine or using a different IP, attempt multiple failed logins to see if it gets blocked.\\n\\n## 6. Review\\n\\nEnsure to periodically check log files and update rules for the best protection.\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo fail2ban-client status sshd\\n```\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe entire process is somewhat meticulous but not overly complex.\\n\\nHopefully, this guide helps you smoothly complete the setup."},{"id":"unicode-table","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/blog/unicode-table","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023/09-02-unicode-table/index.md","title":"Unicode Table","description":"Unicode Table for easy reference.","date":"2023-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"unicode","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/unicode"}],"readingTime":27.37,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Zephyr","title":"Engineer","url":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh","imageURL":"https://github.com/zephyr-sh.png","key":"Zephyr","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"unicode-table","title":"Unicode Table","authors":"Zephyr","tags":["unicode"],"image":"/en/img/2023/0902.webp","description":"Unicode Table for easy reference."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Fail2ban: Protecting SSH Service","permalink":"/en/blog/fail2ban-settings"},"nextItem":{"title":"Setting Up Selective Traffic Routing for VPN on Mac","permalink":"/en/blog/mac-selective-vpn-routing"}},"content":"<figure>\\n![title](/img/2023/0902.webp)\\n<figcaption>Cover Image: Automatically generated by GPT-4 after reading the article.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n---\\n\\nUnicode is an international character encoding standard maintained by the non-profit organization Unicode Consortium.

For instance:\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n- Company VPN subnet: 192.168.25.XXX\\n- Home subnet: 192.168.1.XXX\\n\\nWhen you open the VPN, all traffic typically routes through the company\'s subnet, preventing access to other devices on your home network.\\n\\nMoreover, innocently watching a funny video at home might unexpectedly draw the attention of your company\'s network administrators.\\n\\nThat doesn\'t sound right, does it?\\n\\nSo, what we want to do is: **route VPN traffic only to the company subnet, while letting other traffic go through the local network.**\\n\\n:::info\\nI assume you\'ve already set up your VPN and it\'s working fine; we\'re just addressing the routing issue here.\\n:::\\n\\n## Solving the Issue\\n\\nFirst, identify the internal network of your company, for example:\\n\\n192.168.25.XXX\\n\\nThen, let\'s open a file:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo vim /etc/ppp/ip-up\\n```\\n\\nEnter the following content, but remember to replace it with your subnet:\\n\\n:::warning\\nNote that the examples here assume the VPN subnet is 192.168.25.XXX; adjust as necessary.\\n:::\\n\\n```bash\\n#!/bin/sh\\n/sbin/route add -net 192.168.25.0/24 -interface ppp0\\n```\\n\\nHere\'s a brief explanation of the above command:\\n\\n1. **/sbin/route**\\n\\n   This is the path to the route command, used to set up and display the routing table in a network.\\n\\n2. **-net 192.168.25.0/24**\\n\\n   This parameter specifies a network route rather than a host route. 192.168.25.0/24 is the network address and subnet mask, representing the range of IP addresses from 192.168.25.0 to 192.168.25.255.\\n\\n3. **-interface ppp0**\\n\\n   Specifies through which network interface the route should pass. In this example, it\'s ppp0 (Point-to-Point Protocol interface 0).\\n\\nThe entire command adds a route to the 192.168.25.0/24 network via the ppp0 interface. When your system tries to access any IP address in the 192.168.25.0/24 network, it will route the traffic through the ppp0 interface.\\n\\nNext, save and exit the file, and give it permissions:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo chmod 755 /etc/ppp/ip-up\\n```\\n\\n## Still Not Working?\\n\\nIf some machines still can\'t access the internet, let\'s proceed with the following steps:\\n\\nOpen System Preferences on macOS, navigate to Network, as shown below:\\n\\n- Step 1: Open System Preferences, click on \\"Network\\"\\n- Step 2: Click on the cog icon\\n- Step 3: Select \\"Set Service Order\\"\\n- Step 4: Drag the VPN below Wi-Fi\\n\\n![vpn-setting](./img/vpn-setting.jpg)\\n\\nThe reason for this step is that after configuring the VPN, it may be set to the top of the service order, meaning all traffic is routed through the VPN. By moving the VPN down, the network settings above can take effect.\\n\\nThat\'s it! If there are other types of traffic that need to go through the VPN, simply add the appropriate routes to the ip-up file.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n1.
