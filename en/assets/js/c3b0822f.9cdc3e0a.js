In many object detection methods, we need to go through complex annotation and specific anchor selection processes, but DETR eliminates these constraints, making the entire process simpler. Furthermore, its application range is broad, extending beyond object detection to panoptic segmentation, achieving notable results in this area. Most impressively, when dealing with large objects, its self-attention mechanism effectively captures global information in the image, surpassing other traditional methods in this aspect."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,t.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,s.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},41701:(e,n,i)=>{i.d(n,{A:()=>s});const s=i.p+"assets/images/detr_1-20bf18537c142000ca4626cbd3cbbe88.jpg"},19098:(e,n,i)=>{i.d(n,{A:()=>s});const s=i.p+"assets/images/detr_2-d433d652fadb40a1808d7383ce261218.jpg"},13559:(e,n,i)=>{i.d(n,{A:()=>s});const s=i.p+"assets/images/detr_3-69a48ad1663edee8a24b38940ed6001f.jpg"},59212:(e,n,i)=>{i.d(n,{A:()=>s});const s=i.p+"assets/images/detr_4-d53787cc476c8c3404d9a3bab0d5270d.jpg"},4585:(e,n,i)=>{i.d(n,{A:()=>s});const s=i.p+"assets/images/detr_5-51a03b557e1ca0be4d41e9c32c207fe5.jpg"},30878:(e,n,i)=>{i.d(n,{A:()=>s});const s=i.p+"assets/images/detr_6-0dc5b20dbe6154ca746c614398c4b008.jpg"},2011:(e,n,i)=>{i.d(n,{A:()=>s});const s=i.p+"assets/images/detr_7-25e486fc58029679c5dabe4728b1f18c.jpg"},28453:(e,n,i)=>{i.d(n,{R:()=>r,x:()=>a});var s=i(96540);const t={},o=s.createContext(t);function r(e){const n=s.useContext(o);return s.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function a(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(t):e.components||t:r(e.components),s.createElement(o.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
